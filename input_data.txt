__label__CID_stuck this is a matter of highly regretted that i went to mussorie on june 24 2019 and for my accommodation i preferred to book a room online through oyo website for which i made an advance payment since the room was not very comfortable i made cancelled the booking prior to checkin however although there were several attempts have been made by me through repeated phone calls but no action have been taken yet
__label__CID_stuck worst experience after booking in advance and paying in advance was denied check in at night very bad service
__label__CID_stuck never book from herewhen you reach the hotel at night then you will get the information that hotel is fullno matter how many times you informed that you will be checking in latethen you will find yourself standing on road may be with family at a strange city
__label__CID_stuck i have been using oyo since last two years but from my last 4 booking i have an extremely bad experience maximum time the hotel says rooms are full or some other issues and they dont allow to check in maximum are happening in the middle of the night what oyo is doing they will offer you a different hotel and let you wait for some hours over phone later they will deny and will refund the amount in 3 to 4 days oyo math is if they do this with 500 booking then they hold 5 lakh for 3 days
__label__refund never go for oyo you will have to wait 90 days and still counting for your refund in case you paid in advance for your oyo booking customer service will waste your 5 hours and in return will get a email saying give us feedback feedback for what your irritating style of understanding a problem it will be better if they say in their booking confirmation we will refund a single penny in any case atleast i would have saved 5 hours
__label__refund booked a room in oyo and paid online but the rooms in the hotel were already full we were told that our payment will be refunded in 14 days and another oyo hotel was provided but was asked to pay on our own at the counter but the hotel that was recommended by oyo was so bad even jail would be better then that there were bed bugs it smells bad nothing literally nothing would be worst then this i thing this is the worst hotel around india worst experience everrrrrrr thankyou oyo
__label__refund dont book hotel using oyo as hotels are not accepting this because oyo not paid money to hotel if you cancel booking they wont refund you and will be saying refund will take longer time than expected
__label__refund pathetic service after paying on oyo hotel management refused to let us in saying they had some issues with oyo we were left waiting on the road for more than 3 hrs without offering neither refund nor alternate stay options customer care is fraud in oyo we were just put on hold for 30 mins everytime we called post which they simply act like voice is not audible and network is not good and cut our call

__label__CID_stuck worst service everytime u make a booking property manager dont allow to checking due to low tariff issues and they ask for more money instance suppose if we book a hotel at rs1300 they will ask for rs1300 more as their tariff is double when u reach the property for check in customer care then negotiate then say property manager is not agreeing so oyo will move us to some other properties or cancel the booking after waiting long 4 to 5 hrs in the propertyoyo waste of time mood money
__label__refund worst experience if you want to lie to the customers then why dont you develop a fake job consultancy app atleast people will forget about their money and will stop trying to get refund atleast have that much courtesy even when you lie to customers develop another app and close this app my lot of precious time have been wasted because of the terrific service you guys provide or i should say the chain of lies you provide

__label__CID_stuck Booked a hotel for the first time thru Oyo. Hotel denied check-in saying no rooms available. My family had to suffer in the midnight at an unknown place. I am not sure action u will take on the hotel but plz don't tie up with random hotels just to spread ur business. This was my first and the LAST booking with Oyo. Will never ever use or recommend Oyo. Uninstalling oyo. Thanks!!!!
__label__CID_stuck my 1st Booking cancelled by oyo room partner and I am still looking for refund. This is Tatty app to book room
__label__CID_stuck So disappointed in OYO. We had booked Oyo room in Katra (J&K). After reaching hotel, owner asked that they've no tie up with the Oyo, as oyo doesn't pay them back for stay of the guests. We had made all payments beforehand. Despite of so many calls made to Oyo customer service,we were given no resolution, rather they put us on hold for more than 10 mins. We were forced to look for some other local options because of limited internet connectivity. #bookingId - YEXT7980 #conplaint id - 24635185
__label__CID_stuck I love it ( N A T Y R N Y X M ) in Oyo referral code section. It is easy to use, you can use the map to tell you how far for certain places the hotel is, that help me to make my decisions if is the one that I need or want. Also you can check reviews from other customers and decide. I just love it. I been using it since I found it.
__label__CID_stuck The Worst booking App. After confirmation and reaching the Hotel at Late night Hotel denies to Give the Room and if You Contact Customre Care They will Say Sorry and books another room at 5kms distance and there also they dont know whether Room is avaliable or Not ..This all thing Happened till Might Night ...12Am . After thet kept me Hold till Half an Hour then Disconnected the Call Time is 12.30 Am .... think If any Girl in this Position in Uknown City at Might.Never Trust OYO its worst...
__label__CID_stuck The worst app,they took money from me and then the hotel did not let us stay. I have been asking for the refund from 3 months and they haven't given it back. The hotel manager told me that's what oyo does ..and that's what these people did.
__label__CID_stuck Very disappointing and fraud performance I booked a room and when gone to check in they said that they are not doing business with OYO. Then I cancelled that one and rebooked another one that one also like this. They asked more money stay there.you should sent me your e-mail id to sent my booking id
__label__CID_stuck Be Extremely Cautious with this App. Was looking for a room near Dhanolti. Used this app. The listing showed Dhanolti; how ever the hotel (breeze valley) was 17km away. That too with leaky bath rooms, dirt and filth all around. Poor quality control by oyo. Off late too many glitches in terms of listings and distances. Actually lost money for cancellation. BE CAUTIOUS AND DONT BOOK ROOMS WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS-YOU MAY BE DUPED
__label__CID_stuck Can u please take serious concern on my feedback. In my city Jabalpur all the hotels listed under oyo make a group and they received booking but when customer going to check in they totally denied to give check in and saying that amount has been prepaid,Why you not choose pay at hotel option please try to understand because of this i wasted lot of time, Please take a serious action on this matter. Behind all of this image of OYO brand value is going down by down, Please take a serious action
__label__CID_stuck Very Good. If We GET 24 Hours Checkout. I will Give 5 Star. BEST Quality Service Hotels. .
__label__CID_stuck There is no use of booking hotels in OYO. The hotels in various places are not accepting oyo bookings even though they're still showing in the app. You'll end up wasting your time at the hotel lobby calling oyo customer care.
__label__CID_stuck Worst room booking app ever.we've booked a room 3 weeks before n talked with Oyo customer care to make sure of our early check in but still when we went to the hotel,they said they haven't got booking info n rooms aren't available.we paid 1.5k as shown on Oyo but the actual price was 3.5k, so,the hotel guy denied of our booking. We had nowhere to go cuz that's the time peak time at that place.Oyo customer care asked us to pay the whole price at hotel to get refund.
__label__CID_stuck I booked a hotel in Udaipur for 2 nights and just a day before the check-in my hotel was shifted to another one which was costlier than the one before. After approx 10 calls, my problem was finally resolved by Atul Kumar 40232. Thank-you Atul for your immediate assistance! Dear Oyo team, Please try to be more transparent with atleast those customers who pay the full amount in advance and that too a month before check-in.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience i made mistake choosen book hotel through OYO .They will provide u booking cinfirmation msg but when u go for checkin room will not be avaliable then what u will do @ 2am,if u call customer care they will say sorry,they will take money from u but they wont provide room....3rd class service...They are using digital platform to make money... If u plan with family plz plz dont book with OYO worst support team they have Cheater company haven't refund my amount till date
__label__CID_stuck The service is disgusting. The Oyo team has no provison to check if a room is available with a property before we book. We booked a room with this app and got to know that there is no room available in the hotel.we had to find another hotel from the area. The customer service is useless as they have learnt only to upsell and not help people who have trusted their application. I will never recommend this to anyone
__label__CID_stuck Worst hotel experience I had with oyo. I booked a triple room and when I went for checkin the staff was providing a double room and that too without blanket when temperature was 8Â° outside in rishikesh and when I raised the complaint to hotel staff he misbehaved and showed us the way out of hotel and then I complained to oyo staff and real horror was to see that no body from oyo helped me and they were just transferring their responsibilities and there was no help at all. Highly unrecommended
__label__CID_stuck Worst customer care service. Also OYO app doesnt share all information. They took money to accomodate 3 people but during check in hotel wanted more money to provied all facilities for three people.
__label__CID_stuck Worst booking app. Once you have made the payment do not expect to get a refund despite calling the customer care several times and being asked to provide the booking details over and over again. I was expecting a refund because I was deined check in but sadly they will never return yr Money
__label__CID_stuck Sign in is not working..check asap
__label__CID_stuck Not so good the rooms check inn late. Not good services from hotel
__label__CID_stuck Can u plz Provide me alternate hotel option himashu sir.....bcz my booking has been shifted without concern to remote hotel.....So i will be pleased if u provide me more shifting option .....Regarding Himanshu sir.
__label__CID_stuck hotel debited check in anytime
__label__CID_stuck **Worst experience ever** Hotels that you book deny checkin more often. OYO support doesnt provide any help as they try avoiding your calls citing false promises, putting on hold, routing your calls to other teams etc.. In past I have seen that hotels are overrated even though the servive is low grade( in one of the hotels the water jar provided by them was full of insects).. Once, I also faced issuesn post stay, where the booking amount had gone up even though I had pre booked it.
__label__CID_stuck Horrible Experience, Free Suggestion- Never Book a Hotel using OYO Rooms. I had booked an Oyo hotel ( id- MIOR2854, Hotel name : Hotel Yash Spot on) for 13 days stay in Hisar, Haryana. I made advance payment of Rs 5805 through my credit card but when I reached the above mentioned hotel, hotel staff denied any booking confirmation through Oyo. OYO Customer care executives engaged me for more than 2 hrs but didn't helped me out. Now its more than 22 day and I haven't got even my refund amount.
__label__CID_stuck 1. This app misguide you with fake offers. 2. Very strict check in and check out time. 3. Rooms look different than what it shows in app. 4. Get ready for tons of notifications, emails and sms and also WhatsApp messages if you want to install this app.
__label__CID_stuck The hotel denied check-in because the tarrifs were high on that day instead of prepaid booking already done. On contacting the oyo support, they transferred me to a different hotel, that was oyo owned, with very poor service, management and staff. No support was provided from oyo after transfer when i tried to complaint about the hotel's poor services.
__label__CID_stuck My booking id is NVWR3167 . For the hotal president in chittorghar , they denied due to unmarried couple issue. But my refund is not given from last 25 days .
__label__CID_stuck It is becoming a horrible experience for us to choose Oyo. Booking: DEXI3465Firstly we have booked SPOT ON 65237 The Hangout Beach HutsThen I got a message that my hotel has changed then i talked to Ms. Chanda she assured me that no changes in my current hotel booking.Then suddenly I got a message that Oyo has changed my hotel to SPOT ON 61339 Swami Samarth Guest House and asked for more money INR 18000/- which I denied to pay and the hotel looks so ugly compared to previous one.I talked to Ms.
__label__CID_stuck Check-in time is not suitable for peoples who are reaching destination early morning. Those people who are reaching early morning have to pay 1 day room fare extra otherwise have to wait until 12 pm for room.

__label__CID_stuck Useless app. Booked hotel on 3 dec, they shifted me to some other hotel without informing me 5 days before my trip. additional 18000 to be paid with smaller rooms. I can not bear additional cost. Calling customer care is also useless, assuring call back but no call from yesterday. Its kind of mental harrasment, I have flight tickets booked but no hotel as of now while I booked hotel with full payment done 20 days before.
__label__CID_stuck Get ready for instant denials of check-in. OYO doesn't even know what properties are with them and what are not with them. Customers will have go to the property and inform OYO. Very bad experience. Be warned. It is no longer the sweet app it once used to be.
__label__CID_stuck App listed contract expied propeties and propeties owners not allowing to check in as contract closed with OYO. I booked room on 10th oct 2019 through OYO mobile app however as property owner they closed contract with OYO from 1st Oct 2019. Still OYO app not updated their database and accepting new booking for that propetry. Even no communication from OYO team after contract finish. booked new hotel room with extra 2k Rs. Never trust OYO online booking Worst support from Service desk.
__label__CID_stuck Oyo cancellation policy is simply pathetic..... without check-in ....they deducted 100% amount.....if customer doesn't like hotel and not willing to check in then zero refund.....simply not advisable option.. Hotel don't have clean and hygienic bed....and hot water ......i have pathetic experience in hotels booked with OYO in Goa.
__label__CID_stuck Was arrived and wanted to check in at the hotel that already booked before, but the hotel cancel my order because they said they're no longer worked with oyo. Oyo didn't gave any notification about this. And the refund process takes so long. They said it takes time 45 days of work. Till today, i haven't receive my money back.
__label__CID_stuck You book hotels and either they get cancelled by themselves or If you reach to hotel they don't let you check in because property is sold out. It's like they are taking advantage of being the number one choice for hotel booking. But what is the point of booking a cheaper hotel, which does not provide you stay at some remote location at late in night. You do not have any choice but to roam around with yout family, sopuce, friend or girl friend even you have booked the hotel weekes ago.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience i had while booking... 30mins before scheduled check-in my hotel has been rescheduled and have been asked to pay extra 4k out and als out of two rooms i had booked only one has been rescheduled. Since we were already on our way to the destination .... We had a lot of trouble to find another hotel in middle of night .. the worst part is the reason to reschedule was rooms not available however the rooms were available in app with higher price.
__label__CID_stuck Mr. Naveen Kumar 40400 helps me alot. From him only i came to know that i have an complimentary early checking available on my current booking. Thanks Naveen.
__label__CID_stuck Don't book with oyo..Worst service...they will shift your hotel at last moment and make you pay additional amount at last monent( i booked for 4 nights at 4742 rs and they shifted and demand additiinal 34000 rs) and other option oyo provide you is to just cancel and get refund at last monent. In Tagline oyo mentioned that  full owned and controlled by oyo but the reality is oyo dont have any control at any of it hotel....very bad customer service..i am deeply disappointed...
__label__CID_stuck I had a very bad experience with OYO . They will ask you to relocate the booking all of sudden and then we might have to pay more according to the new accommodation pricings which is quite irritating. Had a bad experience with the qualy of the hotel rooms as well Management has to really check the quality of the provided resources to their customers
__label__CID_stuck My booking id is AHLG0863 and hotel has denied check in stating that booking has been done at low price and I am on call with customer care executive from last half an hour. They are not able to sort it.So basically Oyo wants us to stay on the road in this cold.The class of Oyo has been really decreased.I would suggest to try either make my trip or goibibo.
__label__CID_stuck First & Worst Experience with OYO. Booked a hotel for 25-26th Dec. Arrived at hotel but owner declined our checkin as he informed us that he is no more doing business with OYO. Called OYO assistance,he kept my phone on hold and didn't resumed the call. Again called but same story. I somehow managed accommodation at nearby lodge at higher prices. Received email in evening at 8pm that they have arranged stay somewhere else 9km away from my place. #no assistance #no refund yet BookId :HVBJ2193
__label__CID_stuck Oyo booked rooms over portal but property denied entry due to low payment issue...every time happened same khani..!!
__label__CID_stuck Hi Sharing my experience with Oyo: I booked a Room at Prateek Residency,Greater Noida on November 24,after confirmation with the hotel owner that rooms are available for check in on 26 th at 3 am..the hotel owner confirmed the booking and when i spend 1800 rs for auto from airport to the hotel,when i reached,the hotel owners said rooms are not available...on top they misbehaved with me so much that i had to call the police...
__label__CID_stuck I was denied room at Alibaug. Worst experience. Was with family (with kids) and had to hunt for another hotel. Will never use services Oyo
__label__CID_stuck Started using recently, first stay was good with hastle free booking , check in . The description on app and actual matched .
__label__CID_stuck This app is run to cheat customer and also hotel owners we booked rooms for Varanasi but as OYO had not made payment to hotels they denied our stay at hotel. The property had no option, but OYO had given no solution and we has to suffer in a winter night and had to pay more at other hotel. This app is just to cheat customer.
__label__CID_stuck I dont want to give a single star also but ill have to in order to write a review. After paying the amount online when we come to hotel to check in the people out here in hotel charge us extra money saying this room is expensive one and you must not pay online. I recommend never to use oyo
__label__CID_stuck Such harrasment. We booked a hotel OYO Agarwal Residency Ashok Nagar through Paytm on 18th December. When we reached there they denied our stay saying they do not have any tie up with OYO. We called OYO and they arranged an alternative for us Maitree Lodge which was just a dharamshala instead of a hotel. We denied the stay there and cancelled our booking. We had to again book another hotel and pay double. Now OYO is making me run from Paytm to OYO for my refund. I need my refund.
__label__CID_stuck Tolong sesuaikan gambar dengan aslinya,kami sangat kecewa , kami sudah check-in tapi kami batalkan kamarnya jelek sekali TIDAK sesuai dengan gambar, tempat kami menginap Jardin by olive.
__label__CID_stuck Ajitkumar ankit30420 give good answer 5* for ajitkumar helps But oyo is not good for booking At the check-in time Hotels are not accepting online oyo booking because of oyo is not give money to the hotel management
__label__CID_stuck Iam very upset as no body is helping me out services are very pathetic,. escalation manager and guest experience manager is also disconnecting my calls. Without my permission the oyo has shifted my hotel room to unknown place. I am going to consumer court i am sick of this they are mentally torturing me since 6days . I want the resolution as soon as possible for the same booking iam travelling right now and i have paid the amount and oyo is not helpingme out.
__label__CID_stuck Very bad experience. If I have to do an early check out I have to submit the proof saying why the early check out is done.
__label__CID_stuck Totally useless app. I paid 1/3 amount in advance to oyo for room booking but when I reached hotel they denied entry. Same happened with me twice.
__label__CID_stuck Even after paying the entire booking amount online upfront, was asked to pay another amount nearly equal to the booking amount before checkout due to an app issue. Had to contact the customer care and waste almost an hour of my time before I had to board a train. Nearly ruined my vacation, this app. ??
__label__CID_stuck The worst app to book hotels. Hotels directly deny to accept booking from oyo and then oyo forces cutomers to be shifted somewhere else. Never use OYO when you are outside delhi. This is my third time facing same problem with oyo.
__label__CID_stuck No customer care from oyo. No online customer care available. In case we raise an issue over app, noone calls back to resolve it. Even after checkout noone calls or asks about the issues faced. Better to go with goibibo or other providers.
__label__CID_stuck Worst Staff Beheviour I had booked online through OYO app for 26_27 December But i was Denied Chekin Because I had paid online they want cash They will ask u for cash first when u will go there I had to Book local room i had to cancel my Bookings i even didn't got Refund too That Old man there at Reception is very unfair He even Don't know how to talk with Customers that too in this situation He said to me  Yaha Room Nahi haii Jaoo OYO se baat karo Hamari problem nahi haii 
__label__CID_stuck I'm sharing here,I had done 2 bookings(payment was done) , which they shifted 1 of the booking to anther hotel without getting my acceptance. After dat when I called them, 1 of them denied vry rudely. Then 2 times they fooled me by nit respndg. Then one called and said the issue will be resolved and u wil get a call soon. When I checked my bookings in oyo app it was shown as the payment is not done. I don't knw how can one handle their customers so irresponsibly. A big Thumbs down guys??????
__label__CID_stuck I booked oyo room booking id NPE14630 AT HOTEL JB PARADISE MYSORE. The room has extremely dirty bed and linen which was used and not changed for next guest. Nonetheless we requested for change which they did. The changed linen was equally dirty unhygienic and gave itching. Upon checking we discovered fungus like marks and dirty patches. Extremely disappointed. It's fraud to not service despite and provide basic cleanlin charging 1600 for a night.Will strongly recommend people to stop using oyo
__label__CID_stuck Zero customer experience with this app.. Had an improper hotel staff tried to broke in the two rooms we checked into, with no concrete reason. For such big issue, nowhere to complain to...
__label__CID_stuck These oyo never told you what they are doing i booked a room more than 10 days ago now today they msg me that your booking is shift to other hotel then after some time tells me that AS PER YOUR REQUEST we cancelled your booking l, previously i booked a room where receptionist denied for the booking... Wort company ever please use mmt or goibibo instead at least they clear everything before doing the booking
__label__CID_stuck Booked pre paid for pune hotel thru paytm, the hotel owner denied for stay, the customer service is so unreliable, as a whole not worth.
__label__CID_stuck Check in always denies
__label__CID_stuck Oyo fraudulent cheater don't believe oyo the booking denied at hotel three times
__label__CID_stuck Started cheating people. Do not trust.go call hotel and check
__label__CID_stuck Worst service ever... They don't have proper tie-ups with the properties. I booked 2 rooms for one of the resort in virar and after reaching the property, manager denied to provide us the rooms. We wasted our whole day sitting outside the resort, talking with customer care people. And ended with refund. This was my first and last booking with Oyo.
__label__CID_stuck Recently I had visited GOA with family of 12 members. Booking ID QKBZ6718 but had a bad experience at Hotel due to some problems between the owner of the property and the manager... They were not allowing us to check in and were saying that our booking has been cancelled. Neither did they inform us nor OYO Team but apart from all these OYO service level and handling of the situation was awesome. They quickly shifted me to a new and better hotel and also ensured we don't face any further issues..
__label__CID_stuck First they denied checkin at hotel and then they haven't been sending the refund since a month now
__label__CID_stuck I checked in on 22nd dec at 11:30 pm night .and paid 1008 rupees during check-in .Next morning when I went out for some official work they packed my bag and threw out of the room .when I came back they told me to pay 1100 rupees extra otherwise they will throw my bags out .this is how they cheat and fraud with customers and also they stole me gadgets like power bank and earphone. No action taken even after repeated complaint.Please return my gadgets and money back
__label__CID_stuck Cheating people. They showing that giving offer but after checking status of booking only 12 hours booking instead of 24 hours.
__label__CID_stuck Worst!i booked a rpomt yesterday and i called and informed that i would be late ans will be reaching only by late 9:pm.oyo Customer care admitted it and confirmed booking.by the time i was reaching hotel,i got a message saying my booking got shifted to another hotel 10 km away.what is this ???no value for our plans...and customer care executive transferred the call to senior team and he responded as he can't do anything as of now..
__label__CID_stuck 1Â»I made hotel booking for 7 nigh from 25th & in customer care they said if u pay 9000 rupee immediately you will have 10%Discount but nothing as come.2Â»The Hotel was very bad & they said nice restaurant in the hotel but it was only 4tables 4sitting chair & they treated customer giving use less stuffs breakfast & asked to drink water just like that from mug & place is making vomit sensation that bad. 3Â» At the tim of check in they said that you can giv GSTN details while check ot nw refusing
__label__CID_stuck Good customer support, Miss Isha ( emp 3778) really helped me out when the hotel Manager refused to give check in.
__label__CID_stuck OYO confirmed my hotel however my check-in was denied by the hotel. It was at 8pm in the night at Ooty in that freezing Cold, Oyo took 3 hours to resolve one simple issue. Serious security concerns guys. Do not choose if you are with family.
__label__CID_stuck Never ever pay online... Pay directly at the hotel, otherwise Oyo will cancel our booking n rebook it again. So when we check in at the hotel, there will be 2 booking ID's. Offer price will b adjusted in our first booking n so the 2nd will be charged a higher amount. We should have to pay full for the 2nd booking n oyo may refund the first booking amount, only after fighting with customer support. Hotel owners will b also happy as they get the amount directly.
__label__CID_stuck Worst Never book your hotel from here. I did and when i go to check in they denied and oyo never picks phone or refused to refund money. Gonna sue you.
__label__CID_stuck There was a lil problem checking in they where saying there wasnt a room for me because ik got it at suc a low rate.
__label__CID_stuck It is good to get a support from the oyo group i had an issue the property Denied my stay stating they are not taking any oyo booking.I had to cancel my booking to my dismay the oyo charged me the cancellation charges I had no option but to escalate the issue to Guest experience manager they soughted it fast and paid back the whole refund special mention about Mr Syed Guest experience manager for making this a trust ful experience.Thank you for the response oyo .
__label__CID_stuck Pathetic. Ppeople please dont go for Oyo ever. It cheated out money. They took payment and sold our room to other guests. Didn't accommodate us anywhere suitable and we are also denied breakfast which was cancelled by Oyo but they took the payment for that. Totally a fraud. Please dont go for it.
__label__CID_stuck I had lot of respect on oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal on this setup but had miserable experience in my first booking. I never going to use oyo service and lost complete respect on oyo brand. We booked 4 rooms on 2 mobile numbers(paid amount online) and supposed to stay in oyo sr hotel kumbakonam, tamilnadu. We tried to check in the rooms but surprisingly no rooms were available. We called customer care team and they were not able to provide alternate accomodation. We couldn't find any room.
__label__CID_stuck The booking experience is good but sometimes the hotel regrets check in stating dat tha price paid is very low nd dey cannot afford it.. Plz check through this
__label__CID_stuck Worst Experience they cancelled my booking without my concern and they give me other hotel without asking to me same was showing in my App. Of OYO. All this happen when I was on the way for Airport to Mumbai to Goa. There are many msg they send about confimed booking at same tym cancelled about booking. I have many recorded conversation with customer care .Where they are saying booking is confirmed at another call they denied about Booking. Totally worst experience.
__label__CID_stuck Our booking was confirmed and entry was denied by hotel telling OYO didnt pay the amount. Coming to a different city travelling for this experience is disgusting. Customer care service is useless as they cant help in any way. We were told to book another accomodation and the differencial amount will be paid by OYO. But, even that is denied telling its against policy. We want our money and also the ectra compensation
__label__CID_stuck Hotel do not accept check in And troubleshoot at unknown city. This is worst
__label__CID_stuck Please don't spoil your trip by booking hotels via oyo.They have no control , support or visibility about the properties which are displayed in app.On top support staff is entirely a team of fools and duffer's which know nothing apart from putting your call to hold until you are frustrated from core. Don't get surprise if you are denied check in and payment reversal as it's some thing which is frequently which happens with oyo. Lastly there are lot of reliable apps for hotel booking .
__label__CID_stuck Hotels denide checkin every time and no refund against checkin denide from hotel staff
__label__CID_stuck Wost ever. .. oyo.. dont book and waste your money guys.... Experience a lot and many pple faced this issue ..... Pls check in YouTube red this dash app.. in tamil
__label__CID_stuck Worst service ever. They have listed amenities which are not available. And the hotel was still under construction not safe at all. Booked 2 rooms because of worst service, unhygiene and not available of parking facility requested oyo customer for change of hotel they shifted room and asked 10k extra. They made us to check out from the hotel saying they shifted and while checking in asked for extra money. They didn't even bother Ladies were suffering & made us wait outside in new city
__label__CID_stuck Worrest app oyo cheating the peoples with fake offers like 699rs 899rs but hotel management denied the bookings because offers given by oyo not by hotel management and very very poor response from the customer care service they can't provide proper services
__label__CID_stuck App is good but Oyo hotel rooms are worst They dont clean your room and after check in There was no television
__label__CID_stuck Your App is fantastic for booking. But you need to chnage review system in your app. 1. After Checkout there should be time gap between checkout and review. Because hotel owners take your mobile for 1min and review by them self. These review are not real review.
__label__CID_stuck The worst experience I got today, it was the 3rd time that i was denied checkin .. poorest facility n support .. deserves negative points .. -10 out of 10 .. wasted my whole time n end result is null
__label__CID_stuck never rely on OYO, I booked an hotel in Nagercoil few days ago, the booking was confirmed, but the hotelier denied saying no room available. oyo even kept me waiting for shifting my hotel, and failed to provide any solid response. Finally I had to book another hotel nearby via walking in. Never book OYO and stay relaxed, remember harassment is on your way. even hotelier said, oyo didn't listen to their unavailability of rooms. shame on such a huge hotel chain.!
__label__CID_stuck Mr. Sajid Ali(Oyo Experience Manager) helped us a lot for the check in issue in Hotel. He has resolved the issue asking us to pay additional amount which will be refunded in my bank acount.
__label__CID_stuck Oyo does not notify customers about changes in tie-ups with the hotels. Customer had to face problem while check-in.
__label__CID_stuck I am in south India, searching for rooms in current locations, oyo offering to book rooms in varanasi, app developers need to check for errors.
__label__CID_stuck The service has fallen to the worst possible level. Lots of check-in denies and a really bad customer support. I do not recommend this at all.
__label__CID_stuck useless app... they confirmed the hotel... once you call and confirm the same thing with the hotel... the hotel denied for booking and told us that the same has been already sold out.Not trustworthy.
__label__CID_stuck I would give you guys a - 100 but i don't think I have it mentioned here. Anyone who wants to know the issue please check the call recording for the booking ID ARIP9510. I have the name of the agents i spoke to. 1) Faizan Hussain (Customer Service Executive) 2) Preeti Kumari ( Customer Experience Manager) 3) Ankith Chaudhry (Guest Experience Manager) I have the video recording with the number i spoke to as well as the cal recordings. I will ask my friends to post negative comments as well.
__label__CID_stuck Never book through oyo......they are cheaters.....the show some othe photo and when you checkin its totally another hotel.....i will never ever again stay in oyo....very disappointed with oyo
__label__CID_stuck Please do not use Oyo hotel. They are cheater. Their hotel always denied about the booking at the time of check in. Please be aware it is fraud and worst service provider.
__label__CID_stuck Postive : @Swati Bhatt thanks for the quick response Nagative : Friends better once book the room call the hotel person and check the conformation,because i have booked hotel in Goa 1month back and when i reached goa their is no hotel at all such a warest thing i have faced at the 1st day in Goa.Then when i checked with customer care after 3hour finally they have booked another room,so better do one conformation call to that hotel.
__label__CID_stuck It deserves Zero Star After a comform booking , i was unable to check in as they gave it to someone else. I was late due to train, whole night i was running here and there around 2-3 am for Hotel. Worst experienced . never use OYO.
__label__CID_stuck Shweta ( I'd - 455793 ) , she really helped me out when I was denied check-in by the property.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience ever! My trip was ruined because of Oyo. I booked a hotel 20 days before. On the check-in date, I wanted an early check-in, so the customer care arranged me another Oyo assuring me, I will get early check in there,But I didn't get early check-in there as well. So, I asked the manager, we will check-in at 6pm after sight seeing. He agreed but when we came at 6pm, he said he can't provide us rooms because they were overbooked. I called them 9 times(2 hours) but no resolution.
__label__CID_stuck The customer care is pathetic and in case of emergency I had to wait for 45 minutes on hold and even after waiting, to check into the problem they put my call for another half an hour. I am using oyo for past 5 years and I am writing this review after 5 years of experience. This happens everytime and OYO is least bothered about my complaints. I like their offers but in case of trouble you are on your own. Worst case is the customer care rep talks in hindi even after opting for English.
__label__CID_stuck Thanks Ekta Negi - Guest experience manager of OYO for helping me out to solve my denied check in issue in such a quick time. Also, thanks to Sahil Gupta - Guest Experience Manager of OYO for initiating 25% refund as a token for valuable customer.
__label__CID_stuck Gud for nothing, make booking thorough ths app is a nightmare , after u make payment hotel will deney checkin because these oyo will not pay properly to hotel, its better booking offiline , booking in this app is a waste of time, i would rate 0 star but unfortunately playstore doesn't give that option
__label__CID_stuck Gud for nothing, make booking thorough ths app is a nightmare , after u make payment hotel will deney checkin because these oyo will not pay properly to hotel, its better booking offiline , booking in this app is a waste of time, i would rate 0 star but unfortunately playstore doesn't give that option
__label__CID_stuck From last 6 7 months all hotels are denied to provide room. They told us that they don't have any relationship with OYO. If we have to stay then we must follow the hotel role. I'm going to uninstall the OYO application. Thank you.
__label__CID_stuck Very bad experience have two times. If you want to book any hotel for ur holidays through Oyo then you'll get little bit discount but you have to be face many problems while check in. Suddenly they change your plan or hotel and They provide area manager number but they are not supportive and not have responsive nature.. they are rude and when u reach at hotel evening time; you can't to search any other hotel because of distance and time and u have to face their rude attitude and service...
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience... I booked hotel and when I reached there.. The hotel staff cancelled my online booking through OYO.. And they said we didn't take booking from OYO.. So I call to OYO customer care number.. Where OYO staff said we'll shifted you to other hotel and continously I have to face the same issue.. ?? I didn't know what's going on between hotels and OYO. But for the customers it's really headache to shift your hotel at last time ??
__label__CID_stuck No negative ratings. If available than I give negative rating. I book hotel with app after seeing the rating of hotel but this hotel is also very bed. After check out I ask for invoice to hotel than hotel saying that invoice will be provide by OYO at that time OYO saying that OYO will provide the invoice after check out. But after Oyo decline to provide the invoice. So very bed experience with OYO. I will never book hotel with Oyo very very very bed...
__label__CID_stuck Pathetic experience with oyo rooms.. Booked Chelsea place booking ID JSGP4732 khajuraho and booking automatically cancelled by oyo. Waited for three hours at hotel for check in. Oyo contacted but no help provide by them. Just transferring call to one senior to other senior. Better not to book by Oyo.
__label__CID_stuck I am Denied at the time of check in even paid the total amount.And after 3 hrs they told they will shift but they didn't.I paid total amount to other hotel @ heavy fares and booked again.so bad experience please don't believe oyo customer service they can make you MAD.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience ever App didn't update their tarrif issue I booked hotel at rs. 644 but when i reached hotel they denied me for check in and gave reason that we don't give rooms under rs 800 I called customer care but he talked to me in very bad tone and used very cheap language And at the end he said that you will have to pay rs 752 as per our new tarrif policy I had to pay that amount But worst things didn't end here The washroom and room was dirty and stinky, and there is no exhaus
__label__CID_stuck Booked room and when reach hotel they doesn't allow to check in after long time word and customer care involved 2 am we get access in freezing temperatures in Jaislmer.
__label__CID_stuck Really poor service from OYO. I was on Rajasthan trip from 22 to 30 Dec. It was the peak season for tourists. Whenever I booked the hotel from OYO I hv to face some issue from hotel side either they denied me to check in hotel , demanding extra money,not providing complementary breakfast, providing dirty linens. Issue faced in hotel Aishwarya inn Jaipur, hotel mannant Udaipur, desert camp kraikot and desert camp royal inn in Jaisalmer.
__label__CID_stuck No 1 worst app in India and worst service don't pay the money untill you check the room total gambling site.No proper response from assistance. Total pictures that you see in while booking are full of editing...you better to go with other best service that serve honestly.
__label__CID_stuck Worst hotel booking app. The price they show during booking is a joke. We have to pay more during checkins. Even if we call oyo help centre during the check-ins and complain the situation, they don't help and we have to end up paying RS 200-300 more or no check-ins. Not at all recommended!
__label__CID_stuck Buruk banget saya sudah booking dan bayar tp saat 1 hari sebelom tgl check in malah di batalkan dengan alasan sudah tlpn adahal tdm ada tlpn terus bagaimna ini peryanghung jwb nya... Sangat buruk sekali...
__label__CID_stuck Massive level fraud is being run by Oyo. But I would tell about two recent incidents: 1. Pithla Haveli hotel was being booked from this app. Full payment had been done by me around 9000?. And hotel authority confirmed my booking. I have receipt of that booking. But after some days, when I called the hotel management then they denied the booking. I then called the Oyo management but they asked for cancellation of the booking.
__label__CID_stuck I have booked a hotel with oyo and again after reaching there the hotel owner said that we don't have any tie up with oyo and denied giving me room.This third time it has happened with me , done with oyo now. Have to look for some other alternative. ????
__label__CID_stuck They can say that your booking cannot be made just 1 day before the check-in date. I have not yet received the refund. I have got the message that your refund has been initiated may times. But did not get actual refund. One of their agents Ravil Lahariya called me and sent me email that I will get the transaction ID so that I can check with the source bank. But nothing was shared. Later another agent whose name is showing as Bivek_450178_TM said that refund ID can't be shared. Gonna file a case.
__label__CID_stuck I booked hotel nirwana at rishikesh by prepaid payment but hotel denied me for check in due to unavailable room. Still i have not received me my refund. Hotel nirwana is very unprofessional so oyo think about your service.
__label__CID_stuck Oyo is number 1 fradulent service provider,I booked hotel in HYD, hotel has very good rating in their portal but after checkin i came to knows ,its a disaster I need recovery, Oyo itself a waste,think about hotel associated with oyo ! Many more stories ....
__label__CID_stuck My first experience is bad bcoz i added breakfast in my account but i didn't take service of breakfast and checked out. Next day i received a Ã§all from hotel that my status wasn't showing checked out then i called to oyo customer care and they told that i have to make payment otherwise my checkout wouldn't be shown. This was very bad experience and very disappointed.
__label__CID_stuck Terrible experience with oyo in last couple of months. 1) Hotel owners are seldomly denying check - in even after making the online payment to oyo stating non payment of charges by oyo towards them, offering more than the agreed discount. Have faced this in shimla, chandigarh and now in Jaipur. 2) Careless attitude of oyo team - even after making the payment at the time of booking, oyo is least bothered to check with hotel if they are still operating under oyo. 3) Not so hassle free guest exp.
__label__CID_stuck It will ruin your trip. I have not seen any brand with such worst quality of rooms Booking ID WZMO4127 1. Check in delayed by 1 hour, was just waiting at receiption 2. booked 3 rooms, they provided 2 rooms only , the 3rd one allotted to some other couple 3. Dirty rooms, cracked walls, 4. No Wifi, dirty curtains, No Towels, Broken sockets 5. Ordered Maggi, they gave it with Dirty Cutlery When you complain about it they refuse to refund, cancel They are total fraud
__label__CID_stuck Did you really thing have u provided good service. My family check out the hotel and at the last they check out single room instead of two rooms (which is showing on oyo portal). How disgusting service from you. Since morning i had give 7 to 8 call to OYO team for helping but, no one is assisting me properly and worst thing is what every time i need to explain every member regarding my complaint and they keeping my call on hold and then getting disconnected. This incident happened again.
__label__CID_stuck The worst experience. It's a pain. After reaching at the hotel, staff denies check in saying we don't accept bookings through OYO. As an alternative, Oyo gave me an alternative property which is 44kms from the current hotel. Why the bloody hotel is listed and payment is accepted if the hotel is not tied up? If you are travelling with family you have to suffer a lot in the last moment.
__label__CID_stuck Fraud app and fraud company.i booked confirmed hotel through ola and also paid in advance but during check in they cancelled my booking without to tell me.I suffered too much with family so they are totally fraud.even they not pay payment to hotels.Dong go for oyo.
__label__CID_stuck Pathetic management, reckless irresponsible hotels, unreliable bookings. Booking id PXFO7831, I was denied checkin bcuz the hotel owner sold all rooms for profit, inspite of my booking & confromation by OYO. I was left stranded at night 1AM on a highway & had no place to spend the night safely with my 2 kids & parent & no other hotel owners were ready to attend calls or respond at this hour. So i had to drive whole distance of 280km to home, throughout the night, putting everyone's life at risk.
__label__CID_stuck All the properties listed here are all fake and fraudalent as have consistantly denied checkin at last moment without any intimation. Please do not book any hotel here as u would never get the rooms since the hotel people change their mind and do not provide any rooms for any bookings made on oyo. Worst experience ever have uninstalled the app to not book the tickets again on this useless platform
__label__CID_stuck Bad experience. App shows one charge where as hotel charges you other amount. On top of that oyo support provides no resolution. Please make sure with hotel directly for charges before visiting. Booking ID UZXS0374 charged 2200 on app asked 2600 at hotel what a joke. Atleast provide better support to your customers at the time of checkin.
__label__CID_stuck Don't pay before checking in. They are becoming fraud day by day. Provided wrong map link to hotel. After reaching the destination which was provided in through SMS there was no hotel at all. Had to call OYO customer care for more than 10 times. They we're simply blaming me and not listening to my issue at all. When I told them that I'll file a complaint in Consumer forum then they initiated my refund. Such a pathetic service by OYO.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience. Will never use oyo hotels. I booked a room in OYO 12845 new victory in ajmer for about 2k. The room and washrooms were stinky and dirty. Everything was so worst that i checked out in 15 mins and didnt even got the refund. While leaving the guy on the front desk asked me not to give review for which i denied. After that somehow my booking was moved to some other hotel and i was not even able to give the review for this hotel. I have the reciept and bill.
__label__CID_stuck Booked a room on the 25 th of December around 9 PM, and paid for the same through my debit card but for some reason I don't know, they said that the payment has failed and I would get the refund withing 2 days and asked me to pay at the hotel. So after I checked out, I paid the amount in cash. It's been 5 days and I'm yet to get my refund. They said that I booked two rooms, which obviously I didn't. After trying many times to talk, they hang up the phone. Booking ID : IJAZ0568
__label__CID_stuck Please don't book with oyo. They are just fake. I made online payment for room but hotel denied my check in as they dont allow online payment. The hotel wasn't Oyo property. Bcoz of that I have to look for another hotel with higher price. Problem didn't solved here.. it's more than 10 days now I haven't received any refund. They only says it's in process. I simply recomend use another platform to enjoy ur stay
__label__CID_stuck Worst kind of experience. 6 hours before checkin while travelling I got a message that the property is shifted.. I mean is this a kind of joke!!! Currently I am talking to customer care executives and they cant speak a single line clearly.. If I get harrassed while checking in I am going to take serious action against you... Worst travel booking experience.. I would suggest this worthless app to no one.. Strongly condemn this!!
__label__CID_stuck If you ever face a problem with check in, Oyo rooms will simply block your number from contacting them, and ultimately they will blame you for booking the room
__label__CID_stuck I can not enter unless I put my Number I want to check it out before I enter my information
__label__CID_stuck Very poor customer service. Always cheat customers by unnecessary increase in fair at the time of check in. I always prefer people other websites for smooth check in.
__label__CID_stuck Bookings are simply denied when you get to the hotel. They will say rooms are full, then the next moment they'll say they can give you a room at the hotel's standard cost (not through Oyo). I was looted this way. Booked for 5599 and they took 8000 from me as I had no other option. STAY AWAY FROM OYO. IT'S NOT TRUSTABLE AT ALL. I had bad experience with oyo life as well. They looted security money there.
__label__CID_stuck We can book the rooms now and can pay it at the time of check in. Good discounts.
__label__CID_stuck Misleading information to customers, room dirty, check in slow and hard, no clearly direction to home stay or hotel. Totally worst!
__label__CID_stuck I had a very bad experience with the OYO in mahabaleshwar. I booked 2 family room hotel silver oak in mahabaleshwar. After 8 hours journey due to very heavy traffic in mahabaleshwar we reached hotel but they denied and told us that we don't have any tie up with oyo. I have already paid for them but after 3 hours continues talk oyo executive they decide to accommodate in different hotel. We booked earlier room in 2198 but later they give two very bad room 5098 the remaning amount we have to pay.
__label__CID_stuck Payment received Booking confirmed Still checkin issue Asking extra amount There is full price variance then stated
__label__CID_stuck They ll cancel n shift to a new hotel n the hoteliers demand more money during check in...
__label__CID_stuck The worst app pls dont take risk by paying through oyo, the will cancel your booking anytime without any information and you cant check in the hotel and your money will only get after 14 days i was sucked pls dont use I suggeste goibibo or makemytrip or any other
__label__CID_stuck Worst. I booked a hotel in puri, went there and hotel manager said, we have unlinked oyo three months back. Customer care service checked if they can transfer me in another hotel, and guess what they said, WE CANT FIND A HOTEL FOR YOU IN SAME PRICE ! SO WE WILL RETURN YOU THE AMOUNT !! I had to find the hotel by myself roaming around with no clue. Please don't say issue is resolved. I will never recommend this to someone.
__label__CID_stuck I had difficulties in check in. Approached KYO customer care. Ms.Shazia from the customer team took a prompt response and sorted out my issues. Good luck, Shazia
__label__CID_stuck I had my worst ever experience at OYO. Whoever is booking through OYO just refer my experience below and then book through OYO if you really want to face the hell. I made full pmt, called multiple times before traveling to Mahabaleshwar. Even day before I checked, I have been assured that my bookings are secure. However I had my last nightmare when I reached at Mahabaleshwar. OYO will offer you to stay at hotel it doesn't have any tie up and you will end up searching other hotel at last moment
__label__CID_stuck I had faced a issue regarding the hotel check-in but as discussed with @shazia ,it was pleasure to be a part of Oyo as customer service is very nice and they really works for serving the customer.
__label__CID_stuck Worst app i have ever seen. Booked many hotels but every they troubled me, They cancelled my last booking at last moment of check in without my permission..and asked me make a new booking at higher prices. Such an irresponsible behaviour by oyo. I recommend all of you. To not to book an hotel with oyo, room are not cleaned most properly. Most of the time. Please don't book hotels with them.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience ghatiya bakvas main 2 guest ke liye room book kar rha tha check kar rha tha jab book kiya to single guest ka book kar diya oyo ne 2 guest ke liye updat kar di thi details fir bhi 1 guest ka kiya jab hotel pahucha to 350 charge lga diya second parson ka hotel balo ne
__label__CID_stuck Worst service.booked a hotel through this app.after reaching the hotel denied any bookings..then booked a local lodge for staying ..
__label__CID_stuck There is no options to give negative or zero starts as this app does not worth anything better than this. I booked room at panchgani a month ago and have paid via CC, but on the day of check-in when we called the hotel they denied to give us check in and even the OYO were not able to accumulate us into any other hotels Yes they gave us two options and we were ok for both but later they confirmed that none of the rooms are available and were ok to refund money after 15 days. Worthless downloading
__label__CID_stuck Its a cheater. I booked a hotel but at the time o check in the hotel authority told that they had no relation with oyo. There after oyo suggested me a 3rd class hotel 5-7 far form town. Never book from this site. You will face the big trouble as i faced.
__label__CID_stuck Don't book early from this mad people app. If u booked the room don't think u will get checkin .And assistant is even worse , sometimes lines get merged and u end up talking to the other guest. Oyo looted me on 31 December, really feel pathetic that why i have wasted my last day of 2019 with oyo booking .
__label__CID_stuck Dont book any hotels in oyo. I was fased lots of issues with oyo. I was booked a hotel and paid the amount through online but the check in time the hotel person told me they are not accepting any online payment because the oyo not paying the hotel. Very poor service with oyo. They are not provided the refund also better you can go with goibibo. Oyo not providing the good service
__label__CID_stuck This is a worst hotel booking site. I had booked (fully Paid) a hotel in shirdi but hotel denied check in saying  we don't honor oyo booking in pick season. OYO didn't take responsibility to resolve this.
__label__CID_stuck apps need to be improved... rating and review option after checkout doesnot appear...
__label__CID_stuck Check in: 31 Desember 2019 Check out 1 Januari 2020 Komplainnya : sudah booking dan transfer ke Margonda residence 5 senilai Rp. 532.502,00 telah di batalkan oleh sistem oyo rooms Mana ini saya nunggu sampe kedinginan di jalan kamu punya hati tidak coba secepatnya Mana rasa tanggung jawab mu sebagai pihak oyo Saya menunggu dari tadi gak ada kepastian Mana Ini bukti pengiriman Jadi anda bisa cek ATM BCA atas WILDAN FAUZAN ADHIM
__label__CID_stuck Pathetic service booked a hotel and confirmed from your side id is WBER9728 but hotel denied for checkin from oyo when time is 10:30 pm after one and half hour wait oyo is saying sorry sir we are unable to arrange hotel for u please try on our aap how unprofessional you guys Are a person with his family standing on street in midnight when weather is to cold and you are just making fool costumer only you have no reputation in market
__label__CID_stuck Very poor customer support. First my booking was cancelled by hotel which was not resolved by Customer support despite calling them multiple times. Then I had to make another booking where complimentary breakfast was not provided whereas it was included. On top of that customer support guy told me it was not included at all & asked me to check the confirmation email. But it was mentioned in email as well.
__label__CID_stuck Tripti_3735 Hi, Am also guest exp manager in TechM, i really thankfull for your helping words to me but pm denied to give us extra matterss then we cncl the plan of check in, but before you 2 of agent put us on hold..... ????
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience, I didn't even check in the hotel and my booking got cancell automatically and now they are saying no refund. I lost my money without staying hotel and got terrible customer service from executives pooja, tabassum and vishaka
__label__CID_stuck Worst app they show discounts but when we check in the ammount we pay is not a discounted ammount.
__label__CID_stuck the worst service , once you made a prepaid booking there is no solution if the hotel denied to give you stay , customer service executive just keep putting senior management. i am going to sue the app.
__label__CID_stuck Worst I had a booking for which i paid online, because a SMART OYO guy had called and fooled me stating, if i dont pay the amount online the booking will be cancelle So I did the payment online. When i reached hotel for checkin the hotel guy said he won't be giving the room because oyo had not paid him from last 5 months. He even gave the option to pay entire amount again in cash only then he can give me the room else not. Now i was stuck as i was having 2 senior citizens with me and as I in...
__label__CID_stuck Iam giving one star just bcs least sense of responsibility and hieght of cheapness oyo showed me on my new year eve.I have booked Hotel Emrald in pachkula for my friends even they have conformed the booking I have proof too and last movement before I checkin. I call hotel they tell me the hotel is full already & oyo costumer care really sucks I am calling them again and again they are jst showingme inrspnbl behave astronomical cheap service and costumer care & worst experience #moneysukers.
__label__CID_stuck Very Pathetic service I had booked room fir 3 people. 2 bro and mom. When we check in at 8 o clock at night. the hotel denied to give room because my booking was prepaid. The were not ready to give room they said give me cash again else go. It was raining outside. I have given cash again to hotel then they provided me a small room. For 2 people only when I asked or oppse they abused us even they abused my mom. Chup chaap reh warna gayeb karwa dunga yaha se tum maa bete ko. Given life threat.
__label__CID_stuck Check in denied by hotel due to payment issue with oyo.....it happens 4,5 time with me Worst service
__label__CID_stuck Oyo staff is running scam, after checkin to hotel i get call from so called Oyo discount team and they said we will pay your payble amount on behalf of you and we will give you 2000 rs discount so you have to pay only tje discounted amount over the link which we will provide, he had my all details(amount to be pay, my checkin date and time and even he knew that i didnt paid yet) to get these information is only possible from oyo database, mean oyo staff is engaged in this scam So dont go for Oyo
__label__CID_stuck I booked a room it costs 1700 approx bt at time of checkin they asked me to cancel my booking nd they game me same room at cost of 2000 . Wht the hell going on . I suggest not to use this app
__label__CID_stuck Very bad customer service experience. Also due to non payment of dues at different hotels hotels denies checkin when done through online payment. This i hope will be taken care of.
__label__CID_stuck Friend's if your new to this oyo app dont believe in offeres if you booked in 50%off after going to the hotel they will tell that room not available because you booked the room for less price ... It happened to me ...i have booked a room and i went to check-in the hotel management told me that we cant give you the because you booked the room in offer ... You just talk with oyo customer care but they are helpless and they cancelled my order and they will refund in 17days waste of booking in oyo
__label__CID_stuck Book room for my family.but at the time of check in property owner refuses to give us rooms. And Oyo not refund money.
__label__CID_stuck Bad experience.1st time book room for my family.But at the time of check in property owner refuses to give us rooms. and oyo not refund my money

__label__CID_stuck Hi, I booked and paid the full amount one of your hotel oyo 13028 through your app for our party purpose, when i reached that property he simply denied and said we don't accept the online payment and I have to talk to customer service. It was around 10:30 PM then i called customer care there was one of the best employee of your organisation Mr. Aatish thakur(Guest Experience Manager) he help me out, he talk to that receptionist and scold him and he was on call with me 1 hr until i got my room.
__label__CID_stuck I would have given it a negative if there was an option. Oyo has really degraded their standards and property quality. Bookings automatically gets cancelled through app and you will receive zillion calls asking why YOU cancelled it without even checking the issues from their end. Apart from this, their properties quality has been degraded so much.. they just hire anything they get at cheaper rates be it in slum or any pathetic area or condition. Poorest app and service.
__label__CID_stuck Do not use oyo for hotel bookings, their service support is very bad. recently i have faced issue during check in and no support be oyo.
__label__CID_stuck don't book through oyo..they are scam..i denied check in at the hotel saying that no room available despite booking in two days advance and the replacement option provided by oyo was 200 Km away .oyo said that that's all they can do.sorry for inconvenience.i was left stranded at 3 degree in the middle of the road at 10 p.m. shocking and pathetic oyo
__label__CID_stuck Issues with check in , issues with properties and vague solutions provided by customer care support .
__label__CID_stuck If we face any problems oyo's response is negative only They said we cant do anything because u r checked in no refund no help Worst app and support service Booking ID UXMJ3127 NAME SUMIT JAIPUR HOTEL SHREE KANJI PALACE I recommend everyone not to use oyo
__label__CID_stuck OYO Executive RAKHI RANA , has solved my query related to a early check in a OYO hotel she confirmed the early check in from Hotel. Thank you.
__label__CID_stuck The hotel people forces to give 5 start before check out. Just for the sake of smooth check out , I give 5 starts. Please have a feature where we can edit the starts even after one hour of check out.
__label__CID_stuck Worst customer service. They don't understand what you are trying to say. And once they understand they give excuses to not solve the issue. I was shown an option of 5% discount if I pay online before checkout. So I paid the amount. After that, app started showing the remaining amount as pending. When I complained, they asked for screenshot of offer. Later, they said you didn't pay within 5 minutes, so now you have to pay full amount.
__label__CID_stuck Hello, I had cancelled the booking as the property had already over booked and couldn't provide us a room, upon complaining Oyo promised to looked after this and kept me waiting for 3hours, on calling back they said they checked my status and updated me and promised me to relocate a near by property within my budget and if it exceeded my budget then to pay the balance and then kept me on hold on another 10mins and then some other representative picked up whom I had to explain the whole thing
__label__CID_stuck I have booked room through oyo app I was supposed to get room 102 they gave 101. Toilet was not flushed properly when I went there. Shocking thing was there was no lock from outside. Manager Saab told we are here no so no worries. In the end when I was about to check out. Owner forced me to give good reviews on spot. Overall experience was bad. I will never book with oyo again. Here I am talking about oyo 13277 hotel Neelam palace in Delhi.
__label__CID_stuck For last 2 years i fully satisfied from Oyo. but from last 5-6 months I have many issues nd problem from hotels as well as oyo. When i reached on booking date, hotel said they do not allow for check-in.Most of the time bookings are cancelled by Hotels.That night i stayed in waiting hall of railway station Most of the Hotels are clearly denied for check-in because of low price. Im facing this problem 2-3 times in last 4 months Pls don't trust on Oyo for future journey's. its very disappointed.
__label__CID_stuck Such a bad experience I have visited to Hotel and they denied for the room and said that we haven't listed with Oyo and there are more than 5 customer who reaches on 31 night with Oyo booking
__label__CID_stuck they are fraud.. oyo gives you offer but when you check in to hotel. hotel will denied check in due to low tariff. and you have to pay xtra money for check in and they promised to refund xtra money. but after they denied to refund. OYO is fraud.
__label__CID_stuck Had to change rating to 1 star. Booked room & paid full in advance even though it was pay at hotel as Oyo executives urged to do.Upon arrival Hotel denied checkin sayings it's full. Their support forced me to take refundl. After long hours of talking finally arranged rooms in a remote place saying the extra charges for the room would be taken up by Oyo, obviously. Later area manager said I would have make extra 10k in payment. Again long hours of talking in sorting. My trip was ruined.Thanks OYO
__label__CID_stuck Biggest cheater , full of liars. Booked hotel in Udaipur, hotel has denied check in. Then they have provided me another hotel link and asked me to pay for 2nd hotel and told me they will refund it (which is 3 times the amount of previous one) now they are refunding the amount of previous hotel. Biggest liars .never ever book through oyo..
__label__CID_stuck I had a very bad experience of using Oyo in HCM,, Vietnam. The property that I booked nearly harrased me because I paid online in Oyo and didn't pay him cash. At first he said I didn't pay him. I told him to check with Oyo system but he declined to check. Then I made call using my roaming number to Oyo helpline. The guy talked about 6-7 mins on my phone with Oyo agent then the said okay you need to pay 5$ more as I took 20-30 mins more to check out. I paid and complained to Oyo but got no reply.
__label__CID_stuck When I booked the hotel and visited the property, the management denied tie up with Oyo and asked me to vacate the place. Booking was done almost a month advance and payments was made. Neither Oyo tried me connect on above topic, came to know only post reaching hotel. I have to pay once again for alternative hotel with higher price. It took just 50+ calls with Oyo, 30-40 email complaints and 1+ months to get my money back. Reference complaint number - 23527531 & 23674521.
__label__CID_stuck I am an old customer of oyo but from past few months all the hotels are charging extra and some are not allowing check in. Highly irresponsible behaviour from oyo customer support. They keep on transferring calls from one department to another
__label__CID_stuck Cheating ???? I paid money and they shifted my property and told me to pay again
__label__CID_stuck When I came for check in in my earlier hotel, I found that my booking was cancelled due to unablebality of rooms. But customer care helped me alot, at end moment they booked me a different hotel at the town. The price was more of this new hotel but OYO paid it from their side. And OYO gave me 25% also of my existing price
__label__CID_stuck Very pathetic service, i called the customer care as the oyo where we are staying is not providing hot water. . They are escaping from the issue saying that property manager is not responding to the calls, and we get back to you. When we call you we need immediate solution, what you guys do once we checkout from here.
__label__CID_stuck Booking I'd YTRO5748..Constantly oyo looses it's reputation because of worst service. Booked rooms are being cancelled by oyo property owner without consulting customer. Complent redressal mechanism is also worst.Mamy times oyo refused customer to check in at booked price and demand to pay extra. Booking id YTRO5748
__label__CID_stuck Make sure oyo is in tie up with hotel after booking.Had worst experience today morning as two hotels in chennai denied check in as oyo did not made their payment.wasted money on cabs as well in which agent said booking confirmed in hotel n travel to that one. Had to roam with parents in this hot climate in Chennai..Oyo,you really screwed me and we customers as you don't make payments to hotels on time.Hotel royal paris chennai said you have dew amount of rs 15 lakh to pay them...really worst .
__label__CID_stuck Very poor, hotel denied the booking. After discussing with oyo. Oyo refund back my payment and leave me in middle of a trip without hotel. After fighting with oyo, oyo give me 400rs extra credit in oyo wallet which is valid for 3 days at night arnd 11:00 pm, they are thinking that I am still at road from mrng. Very poor service
__label__CID_stuck Not good they give assurance for couple has no trouble vin check in have age 18but hotel staff ask to have age 21for bosy
__label__CID_stuck It's a fraud company. I booked Oyo with booking ID OSLB4523, but after reaching destination there was no guest house. Went back to app to raise concern they gave an option to shift without paying extra. I selected the shift option and new hotel booked, but after reaching that hotel they asked to pay additional 280, I denied. They told me to cancel it else Auto Chek in will happen. I cancelled and called customer care for refund but they denied. They did a fraud of 740/-
__label__CID_stuck Oyo not only ruined my holiday but also left me with no money. Okay I booked a hotel in araku on 1st January to check in at 4th and check out at 5th. I paid the money too. And guess what I get message on 3rd of January (after I started my journey) that my booking had been cancelled and there were no rooms available. After 1 hr of useless conversation, they cancelled my hotel and said would refund my money. And after cancelling, they told me that they'll return my money within 7 to 14 days.
__label__CID_stuck Not satisfied. Actually I book a Hotel on oyo at low prize but when I check-in in the hotel they denied me to give the room as I booked on oyo. I have to pay More than i booked And oyo customer care didn't help me in this case. WORST APP.
__label__CID_stuck Dear Guys ,Pls don't book any hotel through OYO App.Because I have a very worst experience with Oyo.On 31st Dec 2019 I have a booking for 2 rooms in Goa ,Arambol Beach area.Hotel Name :-65087 Gawd's In beach cottage .At check in time (12PM) the hotel denied for Check in Because as per him he don't have any availability of rooms.I talked with OYO team/Area Business manager ,but no one help me And without my confirmation the hotel staff check in by itself .Total 3200Rs booking washed out.
__label__CID_stuck Denied checkin by oyo inspite of online payment done . Have to wait for hour standing on highway when the owmer said i dont have room in amritsar. Called up oyo support they also refused to shift me anywhere. Worst experience ever. Please dont book from oyo app as its not reliable at all and often bad type of hotels are under oyo. Have to suffer a lot due to this. Thank god was not with my family.
__label__CID_stuck My booking was shifted to other hotel without informing me, ruined the whole travel plan. Worst experience ever.
__label__CID_stuck Worst service ever provided by oyo rooms and worst experience ever... I have booked my rooms for 4 day at goa and it was confirmed. I got message one day before my check in and told me your property has been shifted to another property. But still i didnt got any update on my new property. I have called customer care and informed the same. They said that my booking is confirmed. After i reached at property for checking, property owner denied my checking as they have not received payment from oyo.
__label__CID_stuck I have booked Hotel Dariya Kinara Resot for 3night(Booking ID QKXZ9715). When arrived to resort, hotelier say they don't have and booking on my name and shows me upcoming guest details. I checked it personally there are no details about my booking.!! Trying to contact OYO help care and Captain but due to network issues i couldn't complete the task. After lots of hell's and bells decided to cancel my booking by my side and i lost Rs.1600 as per cancellation policy n get refund the rest amount.
__label__CID_stuck Sy pesan kamar d bali (panen house) sdh bayar tapi pas mau check in ternyata kamar penuh. Sy d sarankan ganti k hotel lain pilihan oyo. Sy lgsg setuju krn memang lagi butuh banget dan sy yakin oyo pasti beri kamar yg minimal sama dg yg sy pesan sebelumnya (delux singel). Pas sy sampe d hotel ternyata d kasih kamar twin, trus hotelnya jauh lebih parah d banding hotel yg sy pesan. Semoga cm sy yg tertipu
__label__CID_stuck It's a disgusting to here that my elder bro Tanmay Panda was booked room through OYO at Green Valley , Visakhapatnam booking I'd is GNDH0625 with full payment. And suddenly that before reaching at the hotel, they suddenly call and told that ur booking was cancelled due to non availability. It's a very same thing to here that as good brand we heard before, but bring the customer face a very hazardous situation. Plz Friend check 100 times before booking a room at OYO. Very bad experience.
__label__CID_stuck Third class experience. Never book again from online especially from OYO This is my third experience in a row. That booking confirmed from OYO and denied from hotel side charge extra for shifting booking If call for assistant one confirm from his senior He again transfer call for hi seniors and again call transfer to his super seniors and last result zero Total time waste????
__label__CID_stuck It's a disgusting to here that my husband Tanmay was booked room through OYO at Green Valley in 25th Dec, Visakhapatnam booking I'd is GNDH0625 with full payment.

__label__CID_stuck Pawan_40649_TM he was very helpful he talks very politely but other agent is very rude and uncooperative but pawan is very person please check that ur contract with NG REGENCY MUNNAR 15454
__label__CID_stuck Have been denied checkin at hotel after confirmation from oyo thrice consecutively!! Oyo didnt help and asked me to book at the same hotel at thrice the price!! Seems like an extortion scheme by oyo and its hotels. After repeated harassment episodes, being stranded in strange places with family at odd hours, booking at exhorbitant prices, finally I have stopped using the app completely. Beware!
__label__CID_stuck I travelled to Nagpur and had booked an oyo . Evethough i had paid by creditcard the property did not accept it. I contacted oyo customer care where i was helped by Mr. Dhiraj (452652) who shifted me to a nearby property without extra cost and was of great help.
__label__CID_stuck book with caution oyo is injurious to your holiday time  Be ready to accept check inn & booking declines / if you belived oyo and went on making a booking - on arrival at hotel you will be getting answers like we do not deal with oyo - oyo is not making payments for us we have to get 15lakh 20 lakh payments - we have stopped dealing oyo With these reasons they will deny your checkinn and you are on road with your family  booking id : AMSB 3014 refund still pending after 9 months
__label__CID_stuck I had issue with OYO where I was denied entry to a hotel last year in Feb and later made double payment- one through the app n one payment at the hotel(when entry was denied) for which OYO hadn't refunded the money for the same. Today I raised the same issue n the customer executive- Manish Kumar handled everything quite well n sent the required mail of the refund to be done in 7-14 working days. I hope it will be handled well by OYO n I will get the money back within the days stated.
__label__CID_stuck Akanasha Gupta from the help desk helped me out by adding extra amount when my room got upgraded to a costlier hotel and I could not check in. The customer care service is very good.
__label__CID_stuck Oyo assistance is not at all helpful in the case of checkout issues. Horrible and worst helpline.
__label__CID_stuck Worst ever hotel service ever. Booked one hotel canceled 3 hotels finally got refund initiated at the time of check in. Worst service ever. Go bibo is the better one
__label__CID_stuck please don't trust these ***.. i booked a hotel through this sshitty app. price was 3330.. i paid it online. while check in, the hotel person is telling me, we cannot accept your booking, bcos the oyo quoted you the wrong amount. then i called this brainless people, they are simply saying sorry.. i came a long way here to stay at this place. how will i feel with all my luggages.. and oyo is asking me weather i can shift another hotel with no facility at all. plsss Don't use this app
__label__CID_stuck Biggest Froud company Mene 3/Jan/2020 ko hotel repose villa delhi oyo id 7684 ki booking ki or payment bhi online kar diya booking id - FWZG1630 or hotel wale ne check in nahi diya wo bol raha oyo froud company h agar aap online pay nhi karte to hum apko room de dete kyuki online wala payment oyo se nhi milta mere booking amount refund nhi kiya fruad oyo company koi bhi oyo se booking nhi kare
__label__CID_stuck Jangan deh, nyesel. Sudah konfirmasi pembayaran udah checkin, tau tau diketok recepcionist kalo harga berubah. Karena saya kecewa dimintai biaya lagi saya hubungi cs nya selama disana tapi tidak ada yang bisa bantu. Akhirnya saya check out karema sudah tidak nyaman dan minta refund oleh oyo. Oyo hanya muter muter pertanyaan berulang kali yang saya sudah jawab berulang kali juga. Asu, sop aneh, sistem buruk
__label__CID_stuck Most horrible hotel booking app ever. I received a call from their customer care to add lunch meals with the booking, to which I refused. I received the call yet again with the same proposal, and my answer remained the same. However, they added it anyway and asked me to pay before check in, or else I won't be allowed. Pathetic customer care service asks me to pay and tells me they will refund after I pay the amount. They update their policy without granting a notice in their application.
__label__CID_stuck I have been using oyo for past 2 years and also a wizard member but for previous 3 bookings i have been facing many problems like i booked for a lesser price but later the hotels denied check in i talked with oyo assistants and their manager over the issues for more than 2 hours but it was useless waited for 3 hour at the hotel and later stayed at a local hotel at higher price .
__label__CID_stuck I had a worst experience last night with OYO.We booked two rooms via app & made the payment. When we reached the hotel at 9pm after a long journey, the hotel owner denied our check-in and told us OYO is not paying their money and they r not allowg any guests bukgs from them.We talked to OYOcustomer service-3ppl, dey said dey wl refund the amnt in 2 wks, and i hv to look for other hotels by myself. They not even provided any alternative room. V WON'T use OYO again &WON'T suggest anyone too.
__label__CID_stuck Such a waste service it has become, I booked a room in a hotel and when I went there the hotel owner said there are no rooms vacant for us. We had to find hotel at midnight with my family. This has happened to me twice, once in Pondicherry and Banglore. Very loose administration. Other Apps are far more better than this now ! Another negative point is it has a very worst checkout policy, atleast they should have 24hrs checkout policy.
__label__CID_stuck inflated price, deceptive details of rooms, hotels not allowing to check in. There is no service of OYO in Andman and they still take bookings.
__label__CID_stuck Ritviksingh450476 Nice guy. He helped me in my booking shift wisely n also helped me to check in in the new one with the same price.
__label__CID_stuck Worst app and service ever. I booked room for 2 people it got booked for 1 and they denied to pay me my refund giving reason of policies. Never using Oyo again.
__label__CID_stuck I booked a hotel 2 days ago with this app, with booking Id BEHP3218 & when I reached there today for check-in. Hotel manager was saying that, we've no tie up with OYO & he was saying that OYO is a fraud... !!!! I waited outside for approx 2 hr, talking to the customer care of OYO & after 2 hrs, finally they told me that you'll get the refund after 7-14 business days. PLEASE DON'T BOOK OYO.
__label__CID_stuck Booked using offer and hotel denied to check in.
__label__CID_stuck It is not trusted app.. I booked in Mahapalipuram chennai. I pay full payment... room check in date i received messages room was cancelled... i dont any request my side... iam very disappointed...customer care reply answer not properly... i don't receive my payment that time... worst customer service....
__label__CID_stuck Waste app useless customer service I book for Aurangabad Maharashtra they give Aurangabad Bihar booking now they denied for refund they are completely useless please don't ever book from here if you want to save your money go for little expensive or go for direct booking but don't go for oyo or paytm
__label__CID_stuck Good but some hotel in oyo they refuse to check in @ many different locations
__label__CID_stuck Honest review regarding my last stay experience... the #hotel corbiz raipur chhattisgarh was worst, not cleaned uncoved pillows, no toiletry kit, dirty towel no extra socket for phone charge , tv remote was not working... male receptionist was rude arrogant stupid n irritating.. oyo promises complimentary early checkin between 10 _ 12am ..according to room availability bt he demanded 30 % extra from the families who checked in 10 15 min before standard time.. #Boycott hotel corbiz..
__label__CID_stuck Bekaar services by oyo.. This was not expected. I was travelling to rajgir with my whole family, booked 6 rooms,, given check in time, but at the time of check in, the hotel has denied the stay mentioning the problems with oyo Never trust on this app. It will spoil your trip..
__label__CID_stuck 1.I bookd hotel, amount ws prepaid. In ni8 at11:45 pm, hotel denied us check in jst bcz hotel wntd payment in cash.. But i hd prepaid booking Whn i called oyo custmr care dey tld me 2 shift 2 other oyo property I said fine but than dey show me cheapest hotels to check in i hd paid amount for a premium hotel already.i tried to explain oyo upto 1 hr thn i gave up nd requestd hotel mngr to let me check in. 2. hotel ws shown PREMIUIM in OYO but it was cheap.Blood stained sheets+no water+no food.
__label__CID_stuck Booking hotel utk tgl 4-Jan-2020 Tgl 9-Des-2019 Transfer berhasil Konfirmasi ke hotel by phone OK Tgl 4-Jan-2020 check in ditolak Hotel sudah tidak bekerja sama lagi??
__label__CID_stuck You book a room from Oyo, you reach the destination, guy at the reception denies check-in, you are with your girlfriend, it's almost midnight, Oyo keeps your call on hold and this cycle goes on for an hour until you decide to give up and spend the night at your friend's place. This is Oyo summed up in brief.
__label__CID_stuck Worst experience twice, property owners denied confirmed and paid Check-in during the middle of night. Unnecessary expense on the cab bookings as well and total inconvenience.
__label__CID_stuck Worst service, illiterate call centre guys doesn't even know any solution all they do is create problems. I reached the hotel I booked and hotel guy said he doesn't have any room available, people from oyo if I book hotel I want than i want that hotel only I don't want any cheaper one I don't want any better one I want that one only. Because before booking people check many things reaching there it is sometimes not possible to travel to another hotel because of luggage and family members.
__label__CID_stuck Check in ke time bol rhe aapki booking nahi ho payegi or refund bhi 7-14 me aayega plz don't use this app but bakvas h
__label__CID_stuck OYO has stopped paying hotels sever months ago and I was stranded in the middle of the night when the hotel I booked through OYO paid via OYO app denied me entry stating this reason. Very Pathetic. OYO does not deserve to operate as a business anymore. Never Book via OYO guys. Even their Techinical support was so poor in assisting. They speak poor english and irritate the customer. Good bye to this app. OYO is a cheat and their Owners should be put in jail for cheating the customers.
__label__CID_stuck I booked a room and while check-in our rooms book for another person... farzi oyo... making popularity by giving cheap rooms.. and customer care told m refund nhi hoga... ab bhai rat ko 12.30 am pr wife sath m to kya kare... road p soye kya ..room book kiya payment b kiya...or room kisi or ko de diya.. or hame dusre hotel k gande room m checkin krvaya...
__label__CID_stuck Worse experience Hotel refuse to checkin All hotels are in protest due to bad behavior of oyo This happen 3rd time They provide me some other property bt that was very costly
__label__CID_stuck It is the worst.. I have done booking for Jan 11 to 16 2020 long time back when the rates were decent.. I don't how I have received that my booking was cancelled and it was said that the request was raised by me. When I checked with customer care, they were not receiving my issue and giving that computer stored messages.. very bad customer service.. I think this has been done because of festival season.. I would have given 0 rating for this but it is not there. #Very bad customer care..
__label__CID_stuck Denied to check in after booking.
__label__CID_stuck My word of advice is to avoid OYO. I reached at the hotel around 10 pm with family and was denied checkin by the hotel owner. They said OYO has held up their dues for quite a long time and OYO is not even listening to them. So they are denying checkin to all OYO guests. Ultimately I had to pay them up to stay because it was already so late. AND the hotel was also too bad. Mosquitoes, spiders and what not. :( :(. Since that experience, I had decided to avoid OYO at any cost.
__label__CID_stuck Horrible experience till date ....its been manier times i have booked a hotel and shifted to another because if room unavailablity...the inconvenience caused is not ignored ......
__label__CID_stuck Worst worst worst! Infact i would like to give negative rating. Check in deny till now 4 times because of low tariff ! You people are just fraud,just giving wrong commitments. If you cant run your business in a ethical manner,shut down it as also you are going in losses. I am going to sue oyo now because of check in deny and no further arrangements.
__label__CID_stuck this app booking hotels and room application rate provide rate not available for this rate plss oyo Admin panel please undated ok. I am from Kerala i Book ing today Pune Maharashtra place one hotel but an go to the hotel receptionsed tell me this rate rom not available ,,,plss admin check ing aal comments and suggestions
__label__CID_stuck Oyo is now a fraud company Hotels denied my check-ins as they they are not associated with OYO for over 6 months. Now they are not even refunding my money.. these hotels are still listing in the app inspite of repeated complaints which shows company is deliberately deceiving people
__label__CID_stuck Don't trust on oyo for low price and better service. I booked hotel for 864? per night in sale but when i reached in hotel the hotel manager said that it was booked in low tarrif amount so Today rate is 1500? then he demanded 1500? for check in. I talked with oyo manager but he was not trying to solve problems instead he said that he will book another hotel for me but the money will not 864 it will more. If the money will change day by day then why oyo gives us sale for pre-book the rooms.
__label__CID_stuck Overall experience till now was not satisfactory as on app it shows booking confirmed but when you visit the hotel for check-in most of the times hotel staff deny for it by saying no rooms available or by making silly excuses of low tarrif . For new users this results as a huge disappointment
__label__CID_stuck Disgusting service. I informed these fellow twice that i will check in at night and since that is a small city I cant afford any troubles. To my surprise, that hotel had no tie up with OYO as the manager claimed. I even had paid the amount asked by OYO to avoid any troube at night. After a long journey, i reached the hotel only to be denied the check in at midnight. I had no option than to book the same hotel at whatever fare they offered me the hotel at. Pls avoid OYO for any professional stay

__label__tech what the hell is wrong with this app why does it show that i have to book atleast 100 rooms the total is also shown in lakhs update your app so that it works or dont use one booking an oyo room on other apps is better
__label__tech it appears they keep on changing the price of hotels themselves they provide lucrative promo codes and they modify it and fool by increasing the rates its a bit shame that a big player like oyo would indulge in cheap tactics
__label__tech apps need to be improved rating and review option after checkout doesnot appear
__label__tech dont bother they dont give you all the info and will require a 100 upfront deposit to even stay at any of there hotels that they dont tell you when booking
__label__tech poor app indeed they provide wrong directions about the stay totally a waste
__label__tech worst app they show discounts but when we check in the ammount we pay is not a discounted ammount
__label__tech dont book any room from this company they cancle your booking if you book lowest price and said due to technical issue and if booking is confirmed and you go at hotel they cancle your booking and they will not give room and said room is not vacant
__label__tech when more than 30 times cant get any otp code noob app no used

__label__tech way too many notifications irritating to another level unnecessarily glitching the user time and again sometimes it feels like whether to even attempt the booking because of the interference due to excessive over communication
__label__tech price confused btw hotel reception and oyo appboth are different after booking mostly time
__label__tech the room rate it shows on app is completely different while booking booking amount is much higher than online rate no rating for this
__label__tech worst app even if the hotel is full bookings will be open in the app pls make sure your booking is confirmed by visiting the hotel the best option is to use some other app or by direct booking pls dont use oyo
__label__tech i am not able to get login into my account even after putting a right otp help me here
__label__tech one worst booking apps sending cheap promotion pop across the day
__label__tech booked a hotel via an option to pay half now and rest later within 2 hours it got cancelled they could have contacted me before the cancellation whats the point they should tell straight that i have to pay whole amount right now if i search a room for 1500 rs and share the link the same room becomes rs 6600 very annoying incidents are coming up with oyo these days they cancel or move the hotel location without even refund
__label__tech continuous n useless notifications dont search d nearby hotels properly and was totally a useless app for me

__label__tech had the worst experience first of all rooms where not good second they say 23 times the price and give you at original price by saying the rest as discount i booked a hotel it had showed me 3500 for two days and when my dad booked through phone he got the same room for 2200 but when we went to room they said it is only 1200 never going to install
__label__tech poor experience shutdown hotels are also showing in the list and they have not updated the list for available and not available hotels support is also poor
__label__tech worst app to book a hotel worst service that any one can 2025 calls to customer care and no resolution of issue it has happened thrice whenever i have booked a hotel from never recommended

__label__tech i cant even log in to my account
__label__tech oyo are big cheaters they wil deduct money cancel at the last moment and hotels are pathetic uninstalled the app and wont ever use oyo from now
__label__tech there is a section for referring friends and earning after referring and having over 22 new customer and successful registrations they did not pay any amount just feeling that i wasted my time referring and getting new people to download please do not refer this application to your friends and family there are better booking applications in playstore they make profit but do not give you the share you deserve very bad
__label__tech i cant get any otp number well very bad apps
__label__tech share 3 people but app no gift bonus very bad
__label__tech booking process is okay but there are at least false promotion notifications every day they are designed to just encourage users to open the app as soon as you open the app offer is gone also who stays in hotels so much that they will want so many notifications i like most people stay in hotels once in a blue moon so those notifications are plain annoying which clutter my notifications space and i miss important notifications from other apps developers should use some common sense
__label__tech resend otp function not working cant even register pls check using malaysia phone number will change my review after getting reply
__label__tech fraud app oyo did not provide me solution to my raised query and customer care fails to provide me proper solution they made my experience worst please stay away from oyo
__label__tech i refer 3 friends but showing 1 friends refer why pls solve this problem
__label__tech dont believe that they will give amazon vouchersi had got 150 out of the 165 never got the vouchers the next day it ended and tried contacting support but no answer i wouldnt recommend any one
__label__tech there is no detailed reviews so didnt get actual imagination of hotels
__label__tech this app has become very problematic i made a booking on 25th nov19 and since then i was trying for making the payment but the subsequent screen says some error has occurred so try after some time now i am trying to cancel it but again its the same situation i am using this app for quite long period but will have to reconsider using it we would request to resolve the issues on priority
__label__tech paid the amount but not showing confirmation in the app for payment
__label__tech given google location and exact building was 14 km apart loss of money and time oyo is not checking the details given by the room management so many fake room managementseg cuckoo tower thrissur kerala
__label__tech cheated me by giving different google location and address cuckoo tower thrissur which is 14km apart loss of money and time not even provided a proper contact information
__label__tech unable to open it despite downloading it many times please advise after accepting code it closes down
__label__tech my experience was very bad because they booked hotel 10 km away from shown location on app i was very disappointed and frustrated from it i swear that i will never use in my remaining life if u have not management than shut ur company management of oyo company is very bed
__label__tech no option for half star they loot your money by making technical glitches
__label__tech app is not working on my phone facing problem in opening and installing before i was satisfied bt now it becoming worst
__label__tech what a appuÃ¼eÃ is this it verified my mobile number and not created my account and closed automatically and process is repeating it recognising the otp and again closing suddenly that one star is also waste for rating but it is mandatory to post a review
__label__tech i uninstall the app now but notifications is coming again again iam so disturbing pls stop do that
__label__tech i had a very bad experience with oyo services i was left stranded at 4 am in the morning as the location of the hotel showed by the oyo was incorrect the hotel was nowhere near the showed locationoyo hotel managers number was switched off and the alternative given to me after 1 hour was pathetic had it been a girl in the same position as i was at 4 am with no place to go in an alien city it would have been a disastrous situation very poor service by oyo
__label__tech unable to book any room because at the time of booking it is keep showing 100 rooms 100 guests tried multiple times uÃ¼ed very bad experience
__label__tech the notifications are insane pops up at least 20 times a day
__label__tech it would seem that oyo doesnt even know the status of its own listed properties and this has happened multiple times to me the properties refused service because if some fight with oyo and i was left stranding on multiple occasions in addition the app is also dodgy it doesnt show the status of payment if you pay the amount before itself to avail the promised discount maybe oyo works for big cities but for the smaller ones it cannot be trusted
__label__tech worst tech that can possibly be there looks like these guys operate only on ms excel and keep making mistakes one after another
__label__tech location on map on my last book different from its exact location i cancel my books because no receptionist already try cancellation but nothing there in the status of refund
__label__tech bugs cannot log in i have many time request otd code put the right code but still cannot log in please fix this problem i really need this app

__label__tech horrible customer support team theres no privacy for your account details two unauthorised hotel bookings were made using my account and the customer service is totally useless when asked about the same there is no option to remove or deactivate your account and the customer support is the worst
__label__tech why i cant see the pictures in this application
__label__tech its not workingwhen i installed this appit has close thier appand again and againi opened it but its not working
__label__tech need to be improve i e need to send confimation after successive payment by mail what i do till 12 pm if i reach on the spot as on 800 am so give convenient time to customer at the time of booking
__label__tech something went wrong retry are catchphrases of this app
__label__tech worst app ever always pop up adds fuck off app pathetic
__label__tech i have refer 3 friends but oyo didnt give me any reward
__label__tech no confirmationacknowledgement of any kind whatsoever upon online payment sometimes the navigation on the app doesnt work so youre left confused as to whether your paymentbooking was successful also theres no communication loop between the agency and the hotel so if youre checking in earlier and need assistance youre on your own utterly frustrating process
__label__tech i seldom write reviews or rate apps but doing this now since i was victim of a very serious security breachpersonal data leak from oyo i had stopped using oyo since a few months when i got a notification on my registeted email and whatsapp that a booking had been made with my account in philippines i was able to escalate the issue after multiple attempts the guest experience manager informed me that the account was hacked to this point i dont know how it was hacked without me sharing otp
__label__tech please never use this type of greedy and fraud app for any emergency or imp hotel booking they are very greedy and of very cheap mentality i booked my hotel on 2 december for my exam in agra at the price of 545 rupees now due to exam there is a huge demand of hotel bookings by students so this greedy oyo cancelled my booking just 2 days before exam and messaged me to book any other hotel now they are showing the same room booking in 1345 rupeesi will do fir against oyo after exam
__label__tech after installing the app i have subscribed to junk service i have started receiving 1000 sms per day really annoyed how about my privacy and security

__label__tech i booked a hotel through this app i got one for a cheap price but my friends tried to visit me in the hotel and visitors were not allowed it was not mentioned anywhere neither in the app nor the hotel that visitors were not allowed for this reason i will never use this application again
__label__tech i cant open or proceed after entering the otp sent to my phone it crashesi badly need this app what to do
__label__tech too many notifications on by default installed it last night and have counted 6 notifications in less than 24 hours insanity
__label__tech unnecessary and too many notification please work on it uninsalled

__label__tech too much notifications therere no notification categories to atleast customise
__label__tech scammers they send a free night coupon and then tell you its expiredless than 24hrs after you get the coupon false advertising theyre scamming people im also reporting them to the better business bureau
__label__tech worst appworst customer serviceapp contains so many bugs customer care senior doesnt have any sense how to talk accidentally booked wrong date due to app bug and they neither modified nor refunded the amountnever gonna use this app again biggest fraud company
__label__tech this review is not about the service oyo provides but for the app this app just spams push notifications for clicks messages like your room is confirmed this is the message you could get or something like it what are you thinking you are not selling food if people want to get a room they are going to use your app if you keep spaming them everyday multiple times they like me will uninstall the app and use it only when they would need it tone it down a bit
__label__tech worst sucking app that keeps on giving 20 notification daily stupid marketing people
__label__tech why the ads pop out on my screen frequently
__label__tech doesnt allow you to search areas you have to know the city in to do search
__label__tech slide option or booking confirmation much better than just press the book button rightand if you did unintentionally or just scrollingcancel the bookingfix it please
__label__tech once i booked a room at siliguri the hotel is very far from the city no communication to go anywhere thats like remote area so please give full details of the hotel located

__label__tech why you are showing room on oyo if you cant provide room just waste of money if you choose oyo booking by online payment
__label__tech app has no help or hyperlink to help desk
__label__tech there is lot of misleading information in this app i checked into 46 rated oyo 11599 rating as per oyo app and found that it was not even worth a 2 star rating i checked out from there within 34 hrs and checked the app to see how this place got 46 rating the result was shocking out of the 100 verified ratings i saw that atleast 80 were fraud rated as 5 with similar 23 word comments there were 45 same users who gave 60 ratings all 5 star there were 15 genuine ratings in 100
__label__tech your hotels in goa have such a very high price comparing others like mmt disappointed
__label__tech this aap is not installing in my phone uÃ¼ee
__label__tech many property owner denies that they are associated with oyo but still there property appears on oyo and after booking guest has to suffer i have experienced this twice while visiting kanpur oyo should confirm with property owner before confirming the booking
__label__tech pathetic an excellent idea being killed by backend app books hotel but hotel is not contacted by oyo oyo flashes hotel which doesnt exist and even provides reservation for the same customer care is confused between being a hotel aggregator or a hotelier too scared to transfer calls to superiors
__label__tech too many marketing notifications even sending unsolicited smss these days
__label__tech holy smokes i dont even have the open this app to get an add every single day i just dont need more notifications at the top of my phone prices might be good but cities are very limited and if they take off the notification daily then i might re install but i just uninstalled this app sorry oyo
__label__tech im using oyo for last 1 yr everything is fine i repeat everything is fine when i need to book a room at this time all nearby hotels are marks as sold out ok nice fine but still countinuously its shows notification that 35 off 50 off 70 off areh i often seach oyos using nearby after that showing notification with offer is really very disappointing

__label__tech pathetic services they do not crosscheck before update things on their websites after your payment is done incase there is a change or refund they keep you waiting for hours without any solution and ultimately blame everything on company policies and technical issues a total harassing experience
__label__tech plz do not book oyo the oyo didnt refunded my money an app show another amount an the hotle takes another amount hotle manager say that the oyo price was wrong its show different price in hotle and different price in oyo app today i booked hotel manali palace titwala and the manager take high price of room and app show low price of booking plz donot book oyo
__label__tech customer support is worst each and every hotel intended to book shows sold outit books only those hotel from which they get comission chat support is pathetic nevers reply backs
__label__tech too manny notifications feel so annoying
__label__tech fake fake fake i am wizard mamber of oyo i have referred my friend by clicking on the referral link oyo money credit but in first check out oyo rupee didnt get i complained regarding the same and they accept that i referred my friend but they are saying that due to technical issue on oyo they cant provide me the referral amount this is clear case of cheat from the consumers and misinform all are fake guest experience manager escalation department
__label__tech i am regular user of oyorooms but from recent days i cant find rooms at 500 600 rupees please check this issue
__label__tech very bad experience booked a hotel but denied checking hotel manager said oyo is worst that is why they have kicked out oyo that is one point second is annoying notification within 510 mins pops up from oyo this is very annoying now i have to uninstall the app to get rid of the notifications you guys please uninstall oyo it is useless
__label__tech failed to send an otp code which is bad for activation people
__label__tech otp code doesnt come through so i cant even sign up for the app
__label__tech i made a reservation through oyo with a promo code it was fine even after i paid it but for not so long i checking the app it demand another payment which never told before by the app now i have pay the rest really you guys should consider this app if you want to make a reservation
__label__tech i just got notification that my friend saved so much many on the last stay this is not a good way to share someone privacy i do not want to share about my stay logs to anyone this is not privacy please dont sent such notifications
__label__tech problem in changing my no app is not taking otp i have entered otp but app is not responding properly when pressed submit
__label__tech very bad costumer care services and technical team didnt work good
__label__tech never pay online for rooms very bad experiance i am wizard member and i am suffring twice by online payment no one helped proper
__label__tech worst experience i had ever had with this app i had booked a hotel and due to some technical glictch was not completed so i book another hotel manually and i ask oyo to refund money they told book another so i do so but now denied for refundi will give 100 rating for this appvery worst experience i ever had
__label__tech app is not working i have raised issue but no response from the cunsult team
__label__tech revised dont ever use oyo if checking in midnight hours yesterday i had worst experience reason 1 first hotel i couldnt find it as showing in the map also the property management dint respond to callcancelled 2 2nd hotelspot on i had banged the door like anything but no one attended cancelled 3 3rd hotel said we dont book from oyowow cancelled 4 4th didnt respond to call cancelled ps i was deducted almost 1200 rs from my ola money for cancellationwow
__label__tech worst worst experience apps not updated so at the time of booking it books the hotel which are previously being closed and after reaching destination customer are being harassed it doesnt take any responsibility of their fault
__label__tech after enter otp app automatically kick out and app closed itself
__label__tech i am a gold member you can check that of this 3rd class goons and thugs at the time of booking my offered amount was 1252 rupesshave screen shot and i paid for that by google payhave screen shot now they are showing that i need to pay 295rs more bcoz they want me to pay 1547 for the same booking which was offered at 1252
__label__tech many hotels listed on oyo are actually does not exist so make sure to call and confirm your booking with hotel not oyo because oyo itself not aware from its own hotel tie ups do not rely only on oyo
__label__tech worst service hotels stopped giving rooms to oyo because these guys not paid money to them i faced 3 cancellation in same day because of this customer care is worst they say technical issue and server issues
__label__tech i did powerbreak booking and turns out that the hotel doesnt support powerbreak booking for 6 hourswth then why that hotel was listed in oyo i paid online and the hotel guy says online payment doesnt work what the hell im supposed to do and the customer care will put you on hold for half an hour without any promptworst service ever i will make sure nobody books oyo
__label__tech very poor extremely poor just after the app was installed it asked me to update immediately
__label__tech showing wrong amount when we book the amount
__label__tech the most deceptive app i have ever seen the prices of the room which are shown on the app and at the time of check in vary a lot specific age requirements and especially the redressal mechanism is pretty bad as we are made to call like 2030 times till the issue gets settled which creates a lot of inconvenience to the user
__label__tech this is the worst booking app first of all their app is not updated with actual hotel tariff rates and you are denied from checkin what a complete waste of money as they wont even refund you your previous booking amount even if tje problem was due to oyo and not us would never recommend this to anyone nor would use anytime
__label__tech cannot sign in on my samsung a50s oyo lite works
__label__tech my friend has booked a hotel for my stay in chennai at akash hotel oyo 29267 and made the payment online when i reach the hotel he tells me online payment not accepted now it was 11 pm in night he is asking me to call oyo if its no online payment then why is it not mentioned in the portal it is a very bad experience for anyone very unhappy with such an experience from oyo
__label__tech literally cheated me i was stranded in the middle of the road it missguided me looted my money pathetic service frauds didnt get refund it was 75 kms away from the desired place
__label__tech deserves 5 stars but the clickbait notifications annoy the hell out of me
__label__tech dont trust the app it has many bug issues if you have only the payable amount with you my suggestion is never book a room through this app the money will be deducted but the booking will be cancelled automatically and while booking it shows the different amount after paying that amount it will ask you to pay some more money if u delay the booking will be cancelled like this i got many issues and i even have screenshots of the mistakes which the oyo application has
__label__tech great and prompt service to resolve my query instant refund of my amount thanks to muhammad hasan and rajneesh for taking this up on priority please do ensure your servers are updated with right room rates to avoid this in future
__label__tech wouldnt let me register without agreeing to receiving marketing messages im pretty sure that is against eu gdpr
__label__tech i cannot use the apps for booking a room please fix it so that i can use the apps

__label__tech i didnt getting any money on my paytm wallet
__label__tech very bad lag slow something went wrong always comes out disappointed help page is blank cannot ask for help and wallet balance have expired so bad need to uninstall this app
__label__tech the app doesnt update the hotel tariff as often as it should checkin is denied even when you have paid the price before even after you pay the price the hotel says they have no tie up with oyo basically the app does not update the hotel list and the tariff regularly because of which there is a lot of unnecessary hassling and at the last moment they tell you they will shift you to another oyo which isnt good enough as per your previous booking
__label__tech worst customer service experienced 1 the policies on the app and of the hotelsare altogether different we have to checkout from two hotel just for this 2 the price shown while booking through app and at the hotel are also different 3 the customer support is also worst they put our call on hold for more than half an hour before disconnecting it so try booking through other apps or be ready to suffer inconvinience and last but not the least the amount we paid online is still pending
__label__tech not showing correct place and not accept one day advance booking
__label__tech very poor services are provided hotel was not there in given location dont use oyo for booking its better to use other sites
__label__tech very bad because hotels location are different than it real situated

__label__tech it was very bad i am looking for hotel for 1 adult to stay but its showing for 3 altogether
__label__tech useless app cant even send or call for otp
__label__tech no confirmation alert shown while tapping book buttonthis is a serious issueas if the user have placed a booking accidentally

__label__tech what experiencehate these popups and notifications try to not show them please
__label__tech oyo service is good but everytime oyo popup disturb me so much i cant stop me to write this commenthate it
__label__tech the worst app ever to book a hotel its a huge fraud company dont ever go for booking rooms on this app the property shown and actual property are way too different they even reach the heights of saying that the collaboration with oyo has ended and they cant allow you to check in and directly say that you have to see some other property to stay at the worst ever service from customer care
__label__tech unable to open my booking option
__label__tech such a most worst experience with this app very bad experience uÃ¼ed wont recommend this aap to anyone for hotel booking
__label__tech otp submit time is very short so unable to install it properly
__label__tech plz fix bugs in oyo app its cant make bookings
__label__tech uninstalled this because of too much ads coming to my notification and email i find it unnecessary wish could have turn off option or is it in the setting
__label__tech this app is going slowly slowly bad because in the question section this app close paytm cash so we could not open this app
__label__tech unwanted advertisement intervention when a person gets online
__label__tech firstly they attract u with discounts later on wull charge u more dont prefer this app
__label__tech till now the app was working but after the update its not working min room selected are 345 i am not able to book the room i have been trying to do so since past 5hrs it shows 3 rooms available but while it shows sold out wt when i called the helpline they say we cannot help u regarding the app the app shows a hotel at 510 then within 30 mins the price becomes 685 then when i try to book it with a cupuon it doesnt let me book and now the price is 2000 i hate oyo
__label__tech feedback option is didnt available to your application
__label__tech wont allow changes in number of rooms automatically calculates for 345 rooms only and this cant be changed to one room very frustrating no bookings possible
__label__tech i feel attacked by all the intrusive pop up notifications going on every 30 minutes by this app really stressed me out and gives me panic attacks that i had to uninstall the app to stop it all
__label__tech very bad app it disturbed me alot plz dont install this app or never book any room with this app firtsly it takes money at booking time and hotel doest not accept it then oyo app rearrange another room very bad app

__label__tech pathetic customer service there are alot of technical glitches even after the successful advance payment they cancel my booking when you esclate it with the guest experience manager they may give you wrong information and assurance they also put you on hold for like 1015 min and the funny part is you cant even report or escalate your issue any further
__label__tech crashes when the otp sms is received
__label__tech once you sign up with your phone number you can not delete your acc at all a very serious and sensitive point the app devlopers must realize asap specially the moment it get misused for fake users for whatever reason im deleting this app thanks
__label__tech its not being open in my phone
__label__tech add dark mode to get your stars back
__label__tech apply voucher code is so confusing booking button without confirmation many times accidently press the button and need to cancel the book
__label__tech the room which they show on the app and the actual room are two different things its like rolling a dice you never knowwhat hotel you end up checking in oyo tries to take the money first and the hotels dont agree to payment at checkout which is a norm everywhere else once bitten twice shy never going to use it again
__label__tech very bad experience booked room from my friends mobile via debit card but not available after full paymentpls update out dated database

__label__tech given mobile number of the hotel is not working its tough to find out the hotel for the people who are visiting first time
__label__tech too much of notification which so distrubing
__label__tech i had no choice as to whether i wanted to receive emails texts etc this should be optional i decide whether i want them i shouldnt be forced to do so
__label__tech my first hotel booking experience from oyo was very bad and disappointing came to exam in motihari bihar cant find room in any hotel booked at hotel raj from oyo and when i was shortly after going to check in at the reception the manager refused saying that we do not take oyo booking now what to say tell me
__label__tech i made a payment of al5492 on 11 september 2018 for hotel rahul palace in new delhi for 10 september to 12 september through google pay the money was debited from my account and according to google pay the payment was received by oyo but i havent recieved any booking id and i didnt get my money back after calling your customer service what i all got was they telling me that i was a fraud and demanding money from oyo this was after i sent you a mail with my transaction screenshots
__label__tech there are bugs in the app the hotels do not accept booking when you book from the app because the rates in the app are incorrect facility wise also the hotels tied up are of poor quality the customer care executives from oyo are also untrained and uneducated to handle customer queries
__label__tech when someone is sharing the link you ask to install the app then register through phone number add otp after doing all those big tasks your link doesnt go anywhere whats the point of downloading the app then
__label__tech i checked in with booking id yqfm at agra they given me the different room which was shown in the oyo app
__label__tech hotel room rates r extremely high compared to make my trip and goibibouseless app with excellent oyo hotels
__label__tech this app is very disgusting it dont give booking at same price as showing in app it cheated me
__label__tech price is too high for most of the good property wizard membership is waste of money as non wizard people get good deals compare to wizard members
__label__tech app doesnt let you register and sign in as soon as you click to register with phone number or whatsapp it just quits and says the app has stopped working shame as it had potential

__label__tech app crashes everytime i try to login
__label__tech to many unescerrary calls from oyo to check in as per their convenience if not they will cancel the booking worst booking experience ever for such low profile hotels
__label__tech they prices were not impressive at all and the app posted unnecessary notifications uninstalled
__label__tech oyo is promoting stupid hotels which are not even worth 800 bucks for 23k initial price of 5 k with 5060 off thats very irritating to see ro service uÃ¼e where we had to go and give documents to person another time at chennai airport it showed us hotel is juat 11 km far and in reality its 35 km very harsh app though ppl were goodi could take it as chennai people being good not oyo persons
__label__tech seriously you can not fully depend or trust on oyo rooms this company ever showing you wrong emages when you go you will see different condition of whose property uÃ¼ea and whose the property is not showning front building emages and front road i will say never go whose the property because whose the area is cheep and third class and some time property manager can dny to give check in if you made the payment online and oyo cstmer care is very third class and cheepnot give you solution easyly
__label__tech spam spam spam after logging in and using once spam calls started and its not stopping this app will give you abundance of spam calls once you use it
__label__tech i cant log in oyo appwhen i type otpthen automaticaly return back to home pagecan you please give solution for this

__label__tech unable to make any bookings gives this error when i press on book again button
__label__tech most disgusting facility here you can expect they show you one rate in the online booking but when you reached there ie hotelguest house they demand double payment so you have no way to stay there only harassment
__label__tech the oyo has an issue that even without booking the hotel it shows as booked and then their customer service representative gives vague replies i would uninstall the app soon there are enough options available in the market booking id erpc3076

__label__tech i am a very old oyo user and i have always liked all the properties i have stayed in now that i have changed my handset i am trying to login to oyo but it is not working out it keeps me logged out
__label__tech completely misleading the app keeps suggesting discounts which actually arent true plus it keeps spamming me via notifications where it suggests dates that are completely different from when i wish to book for example at 3pm the app will notify me about an exclusive discount on a property for that same day as if i am going to book at 3pm pack by 4pm and then reach by 5pm on top of that if you check the rates of the same places for the same dates on a chrome browser without signing in the rates are often lesser than the app then why should i even use the app
__label__tech i cant open the app after i verified otp
__label__tech worst appwhenever i am creating a new accountafter recieving the otpmy app suddenly minimizes itself automatically every time i uninstall and then reinstall thisbut no leadfix this if u canits very annoying

__label__tech your annoying notifications led me to uninstall your app and give you 1 star guys i reinsalled this app but your offer bombarding through notification is again making my mind to uninstall you guys have app inbox just drop your offer there and relax dont just bombard your offers every 5 minutes
__label__tech booking through oyo was not accepted by the hotel when i reached the hotel glad i did not pre pay for the booking in the app with all the notifications popping up enticing you with discounts for pre payment
__label__tech while opening the app after entering the otp app closes automatically without any notice attempted many timesirritating
__label__tech my first experience with oyo was the worst one after staying for less than 12 hours had to vacate early bad hotel and even worse was i had to consult a doctor after my stay due to skin infection was bitten by a lot of bed bugs i will never ever trust oyo
__label__tech 1the hotel has different tariff they are charging extra once you reach hotel even the hotels are not satisfied the partnship with oyo which is very much visible from their behaviour 2 fed up with the notification messages if you check about the price once then you will get the notification messages more than 20 times 3 customer care is not organised after checkin the room i am receiving the call asking for are you checking in today 4 lot more to complaints but no space here
__label__tech app isnt working properly when i am putting my residence city in the bar it aint showing me options or anything else just for check i typed many cities it isnt showing anything just blank and i am unable to give my residence city
__label__tech now i cant use my oyo money
__label__tech booked a room 3 days prior to arrival and the hotel was 3km away from venue and the day before arrival the booking was redirected to another hotel that was 6km away and it became more frustrating when at the arrival day it was changed to a hotel 8km away from venuecontacted to the oyo coustomer care but all i was told was my supervisor will talk to youand no reply afterwards in short they cant trusted if you have booked then be ready for last time redirection to cheaper hotels
__label__tech worst app after installing this app you cant delete your account what the hell is this there should be a option to delete account permanently if somebody wants to
__label__tech i am not satisfied with this applicationthis is disable to detect the locationand booking for more than 3 members requires special skillhuhbad experiencewasting of time
__label__tech why i dont i get a reward for the first time log in
__label__tech worst never shows exact location of hotels neither provide hotel phone number so that we can reach destination i was blindly following google map and going nowhere
__label__tech price rates increases after every booking for the same hotel even the same room within just a few days
__label__tech i cant apply voucher coupon after i update my oyo app give me solution
__label__tech worst app after update look like a website old version was standard and perfect
__label__tech it cant verify my phone number although it calls my number i request a text message and it never sends the code so i cant go beyond downloading the app maybe it cant verify numbers from the us
__label__tech each every time when i want to login after giving otp this app dosnt work and log out by it selfafter trying 4to 5 times i unstall oyo aap
__label__tech worthless and poor service provide worng location
